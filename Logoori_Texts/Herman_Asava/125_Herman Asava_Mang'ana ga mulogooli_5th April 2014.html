THE WORDS OF MULOGOLI</p><p>
BY HERMAN ASAVA</p><p>
We have arrived at the homestead of Asava Herman. Thank you Mr. John for speaking about the Mulogoli. The things about the Mulogoli are long and he used to talk in stories. And the stories that he was talking about, we have one about a person called Ndiegu. This Ndiegu left and went to look for food. When she came with it she cooked and denied the child. And when the child went out he found a good-hearted person who gave him food. He the woman took it and cooked and they ate together while Ndiegu was sitting and watching. Ndiegu tried to stretch the arm, but could not be attended to. They came up with a song:</p><p>
Ndiegu went to look for food, she denied the child</p><p>
And the child went to look for food and denied the child</p><p>
Ndiegu vava</p><p>
You are crying</p><p>
Tsunu tsunu tsunu tsunu tsunu</p><p>
It means tsunu tsunu is to show the food that is at hand. For the luhyas who are maragoli we are from a maragoli who was not mean. This story is teaching us that if you have food, you should not deny anyone. Do not deny your neighbor. Ndiegu was very mean. Then we have another woman who kept calabash on fire. Then after cooking it she removed them from the fire and cooked beans, and then she told her children to cook. When the children cooked they were there. They were Anakamuna and Anakanani. Anakanani asked Anakamuna to eat some of the beans since their mother had gone for a journey. Anakamuna went since Anakanani had cheated him but he didn't eat. Anakanani ate and when the parents came they asked who had eaten the beans. They refused and the parents made a trap; they dug a hole and then they said that the children would jump over it as they sing then they will see who has eaten the beans. Then Anakamuna came:</p><p>
It is not that I was the one who ate the beans*2</p><p>
I am jumping once</p><p>
I am jumping*2</p><p>
He jumped this one that ate who is Anakanani came  </p><p>
It is not that I was the one who ate the beans*2</p><p>
I am jumping once</p><p>
I am jumping*2</p><p>
When he came he fell inside and said, "ah ah, I had slide" the parents carried him back and ask them to repeat. Anakamuna came:</p><p>
It is not that I was the one who ate the beans*2</p><p>
I am jumping once</p><p>
I am jumping*2</p><p>
The other one returned:</p><p>
It is not that I was the one who ate the beans*2</p><p>
I am jumping once</p><p>
I am jumping*2</p><p>
When he fell inside the parents buried him there, for him to disappear forever. My story has reached there.</p><p>
