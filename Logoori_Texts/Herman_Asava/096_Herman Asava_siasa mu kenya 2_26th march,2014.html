SIASA MU KENYA (2) <br>
BY HERMAN ASAVA </p><p>&nbsp;</p>
Kenya yinu isiasa nitanga yatanga mihiga minyinge jiavita hanyuma hala. Lakini tsigavila tsiosi tsya Kenya sitsiali tsiamanya mang'ana gene gala dave. Vandu vali vamanya mang'ana ga isiasa vali vagikuyu ma vajaluo vatsa valonda ku ma lelo kalunu vaembu vava mu, vameru vava mu na icho chajira vananga inze lyita liange Muluvaitina nende lyita linde livaho kandi Muthungu wa Ndeiya. Na mang'ana gne yago kijira inze ndali ndamanya mang'ana ga isiasa. Isiasa kali ndali nangayo ningikili musukulu, ninzia nangayo ni nzia kutanga liyinzila nimanya manga'ana gene gala. Ku vandu vitu vanyinge mang'ana gakwa yinzila muno musiasa mwene muno, vandu vali ni tsisiasa tsindahi vanyinge vakutsa vatsia. Na vandu vatigala vandava vosi na vandu vakatsa mu vutsa inyima ndi nangwa avatamanyi mangana ga isiasa dave. Lwa ndakayinzila musiasa muno, lwa ndalola vatsitsa kumanya mang'ana gange, venyanga vangimili vatsie komboha ndamanya ni nziluka muno ninzia Tanzania. Lwa ndatsia Tanzania, vanyanza vulahi kabisa; ndayinzila nende Nyerere vulahi samu, Oscar Kambona ma nenyola Tanzania yivo vandu vali vamanya isiasa vulahi kabisa. Ndakilana mu kivala muno ninganagananga haundi isiasa na vandu muno valambugula kwigitsanange valonde kuli mima jia Tanzania jila. Tanzania sivalanga ku mwanasiasa muheshimiwa dave; yila ni ndugu. Ndugu ulihiri luveye ku Tanzania dave na mu Kenya muno kindu kikubitsa vandu kivi ni lushiri; yilwo lujira maendeleo gitu gavula kutsitsagilila muno dave. Ma inze ndaveye ku haruvega kijira mang'ana gu lushiri yaga ndi; mbeye mundu mulusha, mbeye mundu mulogoli yamanya mang'ana manyinge. Ku inze mbola ndi nangwa, tsisiasa stiveye muno yitsi tsialomba vandu valala vanyinge muno vava ku tsa maskini, vandi valilanga. Kuli mundu wa valanganga Dedan Kimathi; ni mundu wa kwalange nangaye vulahi sana kali inze ndamanya nindula yo lwa venya kunzita ndamanya ninzitsa yiyi nivananga Dedan Kimathi kijira ninze ndasingila muno nu vulungi vwa giligale vuli vwa Kimathi yali nangavwo. Ku mang'ana gaveye mu Kenya muno ga nganagana muno. Nganaganagana ndi nangwa: kijira ki Kenya si inyala kolomba ku vwiyangu, ilange ku vasakulu vali muno anoho vandu vatigala muno kutula mu uhuru. Kwalwanila uhuru muno kijira ki? Kalunu lilwana lia kwalwana muno kalunu mang'ana ga kwalwana muno kalunu vaveye muno vatovolwanga vutsa vatsitsa kumwimila muno kali na vadamanu kuvita vakoloni vali muno. Kali kwilana kovola vandu valala kali afadhalai vasungu vilane vamihi kivala kino kuvita avandu vitu vamiha muno nu vubara vunyinge yivo. Kalunu nutsia nuhenza muno mundu namala kotovolwa yakava mwanasiasa muno, iye atsitsa kwenyela liva lilye atuge mwene peke yake; sa anyala kokonya maskini vaveye muno dave. Avandu vamukubira tsikura vala vandu vala vatigala vaveye ku tsa kukivala valekwa tsa vakuba ikivi vakuba tsikwili. Navutsa lidiku liu kwenya tsikura ku yilana ku vandu vene yavo yenya vamukubiri tsikura na vandu vene yavo vatigara ni vakuba kivi. Vanasiasa vaveye muno venyanga ni wakamala kukutsa ku vatse kovola voveshi ku maiti gogo vavoole "oh, vuyu yali mulahi, yali mulahi." Ku vahana tsisendi ku vandu vaveye mwoyo na mundu ukutsi ula alia ku tsisendi tsiene tsila dave. Ma vanasiasa muno vayanza mukutsu kuvita mundu oveye mwoyo, mundu oveye mmaskini. Kosoma mu Bible vavola ndi nangwa "lwa ndali ni inzala wa mba ndalia, lwa ndali mulwaye watsa kondola, lwa ndali mmbuhambe, watsa kondola; ma vindu viene yivi viosi nuhenza mu kalunu ndi nangwa vandu vitu yava si valonda ku malago ndi nangwa lwu mundu aveye mmasikini vatse vamulole, lwu mundu aveye mulwaye vatse vamulole vamukonye dave; venyanga niyakakutsa ku vatse valole mundu mwene ula. Vandu valomba muno vindu maendeleo, tsihiri tsiveye muno kuli vagikuyu yava, yivo valanganga havundu havo hene yaho lyita niva niveye ni isukulu valanga lyita lia vandu vene vala; lyita liu mundu wakutsa mwene ula, neveye imbalabala valanga mundu mwene oyo yakutsa oyo. Navutsa ni utsa kuli mu vulogoli muno mu vulusha mwitu muno fwana Bungoma yila vavugusu yivo vatanji litumikila lia Masinde Muliro sana mu University wene yeyo. Lakini ni utsa mwitu muno lyita liu mundu wakola munu maendeleo valanga ku lyita liene lila dave. Kali vandu vakali vaveye muno kali si unyala konyola ku ikanisa nilangwa kuli ya vakatolichi valanganga ya St. Mary dave. Ma tsisukulu tsiveye muno tsilangangwa tsa mita gandi lugano, apana tsia vandu vo muno dave. Ku inze ndenyanga vandu vitu vikaye halala vamanyilitse vandu vene vikale halala vamanye; utamaduni vwi kivala chitu kinu lwa kwenyanga vuhuru muno, kindiki cha kwakola ku muno keveye tofauti kutura ku cha vakoloni. Kijira vakoloni vakola vindu viavo muno vinyinge ma viveye muno na mita gavo. Na kunyi lwa koveye muno nu vuhuru vwene vuno, koveye ku ni kindu chosi chu unyala kovola ndi nangwa cha vandu vitu vakola ku kimanyianga dave. Kalunu inyinga ya kuduchi mu ikaltiba ya koveye nangaye iyi yakubitsa vandu vitu yava kivi. Kwavivititsi muno ikatiba kushangilihga kovola ikatiba iviti vulahi. Ikatiba ikili kuyinzila dave vatanji liononyia ikatiba yeneyo. Kalunu vajumbe va kalunu yavandi na valwana nende vaseneta, vaseneta valwana nende vabunge; kalunu viama viveye muno via isiasa kalunu vilwana viene. Na raia muno vagotwanga tsa ku kutsitsa hayi. Kalunu cha kwenyanga ni ndi: vasakulu vali muno vandu vajila vuhuru vonyoleka muno, Kenya, iserekali ya koveye mu ya Uhuru yinu, si inyala kulanga kuli inze kwa mfano inze chairman wa masujaa mu Kenya muno ma nindi musakulu undi koveye nangaye Getwork Hengeli na vandu vandi koveye nanga vo kuli Grace Onyango walange mayor kandi walange member of parliament. Vandu va kwatovolwa kusingila vuhuru mu Kenya muno. Kulange kutsie kumanye lwa kwenya vuhuru vwene vula kwenya kuli sababu ki? Kwenyanga kumine vamaskini vaveye muno kali koreke lulimi lwitu komolome rusungu lwere na koreke mang'ana gitu ga muno. Kalunu luswahili lutanji ligota muno avandu venya luswahili dave venya lusungu lwere. Nutsia mu parliament mula venya tsa lusungu lwere. Ku kwanyanganila ki kovola ndi nangwa vakokloni vatuli muno kunyi kutigale na mang'ana gitu muno; kalunu vakwilana ku lulimi lwu rusungu lwene lula ni mima jie kekoloni jiene jila. Tsinguvu tsia kwivika muno kalunu ni tsia vandu vakoloni. Koveye ku ni tsinguvu tsyitu tsia kienyeji dave. Ku kutevana viukulia via kieyeji viatula muno kalnu kwenya viukulia vie kisungu. Kali vulwaye vwa konyola muno vunyinge kijila viukulia vinyinge vitula engereka, maguta go kodeka na vindu viosi yivyo vikuletela vulwaye kuhela. Kuveye ku ni viukulia viutu via kineyeji muno dave. Tsinyasi tsia kienyeji kalunu vaiya misala jiali jia kienyeji muno, vasimika misala jie kisungu. Na vasungu vatsa muno vavugula misala jyitu jia kienyeji muno vatsia valomba tsinyasi ma vatsa vakugulitsila. Vandu vali valima muno majani chai kalunu gavula tsisendi; vandu valila mang'ana ga majani chai, nutsia nohenza tsikahawa muno, vandu valila mang'ana gi tsikahahawa; tsivula imaketi dave. Ma kalunu makanisa gakutsa konyola vudinyu vonene kandi, katsiyi kwingila mu mang'ana ga kwasura yaga, vivi vosi vafwele mu makanisa, na vaveshi vanyinge. Kalunu kuveye na musimamo murungi na makanisa dave. Makanisa gitu gakwoneka katsiyi kugwa gi isiasa kandi. Mang'ana gu vulimi vwene vwa kovola yimu aveye ku na vandu va agriculture vandu vasomela mang'ana gu vulimi vanyala kutsa muno kwigitsa vandu mang'ana gu vulimi valimi vindu viene via kienyeji muno ku vanyole tsisendi dave anoho. Kuli kwa mfano ikahawa ya mbola yiyi; nitsia ingereka ibei eveye ku igulu indahi sana na iveye mu ni vindu vinyinge tsinyasi mu tsinyinge. Na vandu vitu muno venya kolonda vindu viene vila dave. Mashini gaveye muno kalunu gayinzila muno yaga ni ga vandu ve kegeni. Kalunu vandu vita vandi muno koveye ku ni kindu mashini gosi gagimilanga kumanyia ndi uyu yitwiyi kijira ki dave. Mashini gatsa kwita muno kalunu gagimila muno mang'ana na mashini ga vandu kegeni. Nutsia nohenza tsikoti tsyitu tsia koveye nangatsio, eveku ni yunyala kutsia mu onyole mu vulungi dave. Vandu ve ekoti vala vava vandu valitsa soya. Ekoti ya mang'ana gogo ganyala kuhulika mu vulungi dave. Vapolisi vosi vakwingila mu mang'ana ga asoya, vatsiyi kuhambana na vivi vala vosi, na vandu vadamanu vala vosi; kalunu itabu iveye mu kivala muno ya vapolisi na vandu vi tsikoti vakubitsa vandu kivi. Ma kalunu vandu vadamanu vakwingila, kali nukubila polisi isimu, polisi vatsa dave. Kalunu mang'ana gi tsimbabala, midoga jiosi jireti itabu, jimala vandu muno kijira vapolsisi vaveye kunzila venya tsisendi tsieng'ine asoya kuvika mu tsimuya lakini kolonda manga'na gu kwigala mang'ana kuli gaveye ga Michuki yaveye na yinzila muno; kalunu gaveye muno dave. Na inze ndakatevi ndi nangwa inze ndakamenyaTanzania madiku matambi, Kenya vatsie kwiga mang'ana ga Tanzania yila, vamenya ndi nangwa; misala minyinge jiveye Tanzania, vindi vinyinge viveye Tanzania yila viveye vie kivune kabisa via vienyekanga vandu va Kenya vatsie kwiga ku vindu viene vila. Ma kalunu Kenya venya kwiga mang'ana gi vivala vinde dave. Ndakayanzi ndi nangwa vandu vitu va Kenya muno, vandu kuli inze nangwa kalunu ndakamenya kali ndakagenda mu vivala vie ichova yivi ndakamenya ku India, Ivungeresa, vivala via Vaarabu ndakamanya mima jiveye ku yo. Vandu vitu va Kenya muno mugirung'anyie Kenya yinu ivuli kuva indamanu kuvita yali ye kekoloni yila dave. Itsie ku musingi guveye mulahi gwa kunyala kumanya Kenya ihona ndi nangwa. Ma mu kivala chitu che ivulusha kinu chakuchula inyuma wene indamanu, kali nutsia mu maketi yimu onyola kalunu tsihiri tsinde tsiveye mu, Vahindi yivo vaveye mu ni viasara; kunyi kuveye mu ni viasara dave; vindu vinyinge muno ni via vahindi na vasomali. Na vasomali vavola yivo vaononyia Mombasa. Mombasa yakwoneka kijira mang'ana ga vasomali, vakutsa yo. Ni kivala cha Mombasa lwa kwavugula kitula lovega lwa Sudan anoho Zanzibar; kwavugula kovola ni cha Kenya. Kalunu Kenya yakugilung'ana ilihe liveye Mombasa ulanyola vandu va Zanzibar, Sudan vavuguyi kivala chene kila kijira mima jiveye muno ni milahi dave. Ma kali kovola ,giligale, Mombasa wene yila vandu va Coast vala si vaganaganywa sia vandu va Kenya dave. Tsigasi tsitula muno vaganaganyiaku vandu va Coast vala kuli na vandu va Kenya dave. Tsigasi tsitula muno sivaganaganyia ku vandu valusha na vakenya dave ma itigala tsa ni ihiri indala. Nuutsa kalunu nutsia nohenza tsisogoni yitsi, vindu vitsa muno; kali isukari ya kutumukila yiyi inyinge ni itula engereka, maguta ga kodekera, tsinyasi; ni vindi vinge. Nutsia kalunu musivitali unyala konyola mu lunyasi vulungi dave; kalunu nutsia konyola lunyasi nu muchemist na tsinyasi tsiveye mu yitsi ni tsitula engereka ma tsitsa mutsisivitali ma tsirana tsigulung'anyua tsitsia mu chemist ya vandu binafsi; madaktari gene yaga. Kalunu madagtari vatsitsa kutula mu serekali; vatsitsa kutangitsa tsi chemist tsiavo kijira serekali si chungusa ku mang'ana gi tsisivitali kumanya kijira ki tsivitali tsigwitsanga ndi nangwa dave. Vigitsi va koveye nangavo muno yava, ndaganagananga serekali ilaganagana ku mundu wosi utulanga hasi hano natsia igulu natsia konyola igasi atulana mu lovega lwu mwigitsi; yigitswanga. Kalunu vigitsi vakusuvwa ichova, vatigaye va chama cha upinzani mu Kenya muno. Na vigitsi yivo vadukananga yivo vaveye serekali, ma daktari yigo gadukana gahonyie vandu muno; ma kandi mang'ana gi tsinyasi kovole tsia kienyeji, yitsio tsia kwadukananga Kenya yinu ilalomba vandu vitu va utamaduni vave ku ni tsinyasii tsia kitamaduni yitsi tsikonya ku vandu. Kijira nyasaye navolela Musa utsyi mu kivala cha Kanani, yali kijira misala jiali mu ni migera jiali mu ni militu jiali mu jiali milahi sana. Ma kandi vigulu vio muno viveye vilahi viveye mu ni kivune. Kalunu vigulu viali muno viosi viayoneka, militu jiosi jiveye mu dave; nutsia mmulitu gwitu gwa Vihiga yigu kalunu jiatimulwa kindu kiveye ho dave. Yimwo mwa nyasaye yavika vunyali vwosi konyole mu vugasu mwene mula. Kalunu ndi vindu viene vila viveye mu dave. Ku kuteva ndi nangwa vutamaduni vwitu vwa kwenyeramu ni eserekali yitu vuveye hayi? Kalunu mang'ana ga avana komoloma ululimi lwitu; avana vakwigitswa lusungu lwere, vana vakutsutsu vamoloma tsa lusungu lwere, vamoloma lulimi lwavo dave. Ku ndakayanzi luswahili lwilane mu kivala muno ninde tsinimi tsindi tsirane. Kuli Tanzania vaveye tsa nende lulimi lwavo lwu luswahili; lokola vulahi sana. Ni tsinimi tsindi tsitsa ku inyuma. Ku ndakayanzi Kenya yitu yinu kali kuli lwa inze mbeye ndi nangwa, niva ni serekali ya Kenya yaganagananga yenyanga ikonye ku vasakulu kuli kunyi ndi nangwa; kali inze mbeye nu mudoga hano, mudriver, ngani serekali yaininda hano kali ngano mbeye nu musigari dave kijira si ndahevwa ku igasi mu serekali dave. Lwa ndakatovolwa chairman wa masujaa mu Kenya mbeye ni kindu chosi dave. Kali lwa Kibaki yaveye kondeve, nimbandika ibarua nembola ndi vandu vwa kwatovolwangwa va masuja mu Kenya valangwe vatsie kwikala halala nende serekali yeneyo, valole makosa gakoreka kijira kwenyekananga korekebishe makosa gene gala.

POLITICS IN KENYA (2)</p><p>
BY HERMAN ASAVA</p><p>
In Kenya politics began many years ago. But many tribes in Kenya didn't know about those things. People who knew it were the gikuyu, then luo and the embu, the meru were in and that is the reason to why they called me "Muluvaitina" another name was there called "muthungu wa Ndeiya" because I knew politics. I had politics while I was still in school; I began working when I had known those issues of politics. People who had good politics most of them have died and gone.</p><p>
People who have remained in are the people who joined politics recently and they do not know anything about politics. When I was doing politics and I realized that people had started knowing my secrets and they wanted to arrest me, I ran away to Tanzania. When I went to Tanzania people there were very happy, I worked with Nyerere very well. Oscar Kambona and I realized that people in Tanzania knew politics well. I came back to this country thinking that the people here will join me and we teach each other politics and they follow the behaviours of Tanzania. People in Tanzania do not call a member of parliament honourable, there they call one a brother. There is no tribal difference in Tanzania, but what are disturbing people here in Kenya is tribalism. That is what is causing our development to be poor. I was aside because of this tribal issues. I am a luhya person, specifically a maragooli who knows a lot of things. I am saying this that the politics that is in Kenya has caused some people to become poor, some are crying. We have someone like Dedan Kimathi, this is someone whom we were together very well. I even came and stayed with Dedan Kimathi when they wanted to kill me because I stood for the truth, that Kimathi had. There are things in Kenya that I am really thinking about. I am wondering why can Kenya not call the old men that remained since independence. Why did we fight for independence, these days the people that are ruling are even worse than the colonists who were here. </p><p>
Some of us are even saying that it is better for the white to come back and rule this nation than the people who are ruling with lies. These days when someone is elected he goes and thinks of himself. He cannot assist the poor who are in this nation. The people who vote for them are left, there they cry with no hope they have problems. Then the day when he want votes, he comes back to them begging for votes and yet he left those people in trouble. We have politicians who wants to come when you have died then they speak lies "oh, he was a good man" then they give money to people who are alive and the person who has died wont spend the money.</p><p>
Politicians love dead people than those who are alive. A poor person we read from the bible that; when I was hungry, you gave me and I ate when I was sick you came and visited me. When I was in trouble you came and visited me. When you check through these things our people do not follow, that when someone is poor you come and visit him/her. When someone is sick they come visit the person and help him. They want when someone has died that is when they come to visit the person. Other people are developing their places like the Gikuyu are the people who name a place or a school after their own hero, name of that person who died. If it's a road they name it after that person who died.</p><p>
But when you come to our luhya land, maybe in Bungoma that is where the people have started naming their universities after Masinde Muliro. But when you come here people who did development are not named after. Even the elders who are here you cannot find a church named the way the catholic do like St. Mary. Schools that are here are given different names. Not the names of the people who are here. I want our people to sit together and recognize what we did when we wanted independence in this nation that is different from the colonial one.</p><p>
Colonists did a lot of their things here and they have their names. And we have independence but there is nothing that can be recognized or seen. The constitution disturbed people. We celebrated that the constitution was passed. The constitution has not started functioning; they have started destroying the constitution. The Members of Parliament are now fighting the senators. We also have some parties that are fighting each other. </p><p>
Citizens in this nation are wondering where are we heading. What we want now is this; the old men who are here and caused this nation to get independence for example, I the chairman of heroes and Getwork Hengeli and other people like Grace Onyango who was a mayor and the Member of Parliament. People who were appointed to stand for independence in Kenya they call us and find out how we got independence. They want to push the poor, we leave our tribe and speak pure English alone and we leave our things. Kiswahili has started disappearing, people do not want Kiswahili they want English alone. When you go to the parliament they want English alone. Now why did we struggle for the colonist to leave this place and we remain with our things. Now they have turned to the English language and the ways of the colonists. The clothes that we are putting on now are for the colonists. We do not have our own traditional clothes. We wonder our traditional meals are lost we want processed meals. The sickness that we are having are as a result of the American meals, the oil that we are using and other things are the ones that are causing these diseases and we perish. We do not have our traditional meals here. For the herbs they have uprooted the herbal trees and planted the American trees. The americans come and take our trees then they go and process medicine out of the trees then they sell them back to us. People had planted tea, and these days the tea does not have value, people are complaining about the tea. When you check the coffee people are complaining about the coffee they do not have market.</p><p>
Churches have found a lot of problems, they are getting into the things that we are refusing; thieves have entered into the churches. And they are lying. We do not have the standing truth in church. Our churches have spoiled and turned into politics. About farming there are no people who have trained about agriculture that can come and teach people about planting traditional food and get money. For example coffe has a lot of value when sold abroad it is very expensive. And it has a lot of medicine.</p><p>
People here do not want to follow those things. The machines that are operating in this nation are from the foreign land. People are killing one another and we do not have the machines that can identify what killed the person. The machines that we are using here to capture the words of people are the machines from the foreign land. When you go to our courts there is no truth there. The people at the court are the ones who do corruption. Your case cannot be heard with reality. All the police are corrupt. They have joined with the thieves and the all the other bad people. There is trouble in this land about the police and the people at the court who are troubling people. We have bad people even when you call the police they do not come. On the roads, vehicles are causing problems, they are finishing people here because the police on the road want money alone, they want corruption and they do not want to work the way Michuki was working, they no longer follow that. I may ask; I stayed in Tanzania for long days, Kenya should go and learn the things of Tanzania. The way they are living. There are a lot of trees in Tanzania. There are a lot of things in Tanzania that are of great value that the people of Kenya should go and learn about them. Kenya does not want to learn about things from other nations. I have moved around many places, I have stayed in India, America, Araabic nations I have learned the culture that is there. People of Kenya should change Kenya, for it to be better than the one of the colonial people </p><p>
It should move to a good foundation that we should know that Kenya is healing. Our luhya land is behind; when you go to the market you find other tribes there. The Hindu are the ones who have business there, we do not have business there, most of the things belong to the Hindu and the Somalia people. The Somalia people are the ones who are destroying Mombasa. Mombasa has been destroyed because of the Somalia people who have come there. And when we took the land of Mombasa from Sudan or Zanzibar claiming that is the land of Kenya. Now there is war in Mombasa you find the people of Zanzibar and Sudan because there are no good morals there. Even by speaking the truth the people of coast do not take themselves as the people of Kenya. When job opportunities arrises the luhya people are not considered as Kenyans. When you check even at the market the sugar that we are using much of it is imported from America even the oil that we are using for cooking, medicine and other things. When you go at the hospital you cannot find pure medicine. The medicines that are in the chemists are from abroad then they go through the hospitals, they are then turned and taken to the chemists that belong to the doctors. The doctors are quiting governmental jobs and start their chemist because the government does not follow up the reasons to why the hospitals are going down. </p><p>
The teachers that we have I thought the government will consider, these people who are coming from down especially from the sector of teaching. Teachers have been thrown out. They have remained as opposition parties in Kenya. And the teachers are the ones who are government and the doctors are supposed to treat people. Kenya should also consider the cultural people who have medicine that can assist people. That is the reason to why God asked Moses to go to the land of Canaan, it was because the land had trees, rivers and forests that were very nice.</p><p>
The mountains here are very important they have value. The mountains that were here have been destroyed, the forest have been destroyed. When you go to our forest in vihiga it has been destroyed there is nothing there. That is where God kept all the ability that we find blessings there. We no longer have those things there. We are asking where is our culture that we used to find our government. Today on the issue of children speaking our own language, the children have been taught English. Young children are speaking English alone. They are not speaking their language. I would like to have Swahili and other languages to come back to this nation. Like the Tanzanians have their own language which is Swahili, that is doing well there. Then the other languages follow. </p><p>
I would like Kenya to assist the way I am even if the government of Kenya wanted to assist old men like us I should have a vehicle, a driver. The government could be taking care of me by now. I do not have a bodyguard because I wasn't given work in the government. When I was appointed as the chaiman of heroes in Kenya, I do not have anything. I wrote a letter to Kibaki saying that the people who were heroes should be invited to seat together with the government, they see the mistakes that are taking place because we need to rectify them.</p><p>
Then our constitution should run for five years we see the way it is. This constitution should not be corrected the Members of Parliament, the citizens are the ones who are supposed to correct it the members of parliament have gone to the parliament and they are saying that they are correcting the constitution. We are the ones to do that. The way I said, the courts that we have are corrupt. The issues of ICC should not be done here, because the courts here are not trustworthy. The people sign that they are going to share with the people of ICC. They are asking why is it being brought here. People have died and some are being killed. People there do not say how those people were killed. People are living iin tents. Some children have been left orphans. Women have been left widows. There is no one who can speak the truth about the people who killed or where they were killed. </p><p>
We want the people who are fighting the ICC cases to be solved in Kenya, to give us the evidence of the people who died here, and the reasons to why they do not want ICC. Since the cases are there we know of ICC alone, whether they rule well or not. What do they fear there? That is what I am thinking, I have a lot of things but I don't to have someone who can assist me. And the man called Getwork Hengeli is the one that I was supposed to sit with, and Uhuru was to invite us even when Moi is still alive. Moi is afraid of me, the words that I wrote to him, made him afraid of me. I worked with moi for many years together with Masinde Muliro, he should not be afraid of me. Moi is the one that I should have shared a seat and share issues. Moi is the one who sent Peter Kibisu and Moses Mudavadi to come and kill me. I may ask Moi while he is still alive; what mistake did I make that I was to be killed. I have remained poor; I do not have any means. I believe that is what I have for politics.</p><p>
