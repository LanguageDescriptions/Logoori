POLITICS IN KENYA (1)</p><p>
BY HERMAN ASAVA</p><p>
For me when politics began in Kenya I was in Kikuyu land and I was working there in a hotel at Limuru. And when politics began, white men didn't want the Kikuyu. They began making noise and fighting. A white-man short a Kikuyu lady and that is when war began, then name MAUMAU was as a result of eliminating the white men from this land. And politics began from there. And the Gikuyu wanted the land, and the white men to leave this place and go outside. I joined them. I joined the MAUMAU in fighting.</p><p>
Kenyatta was arrested in th year 1952 and I ran away in the year 1955, they wanted to arrest me and I went to the Lodwar then to Maralal then to Kapenguria. I have done politics in this place for a long time that Kenya should not forget me. I am the one who was dealing with Mboya, Oginga in many other things. I have made a lot of things in this place. I am among the people who went to Lancaster House to go and make the constitution of Kenya. There are a lot of problems in Kenya; these people do not consider people who have done a lot of activities on this land. When people saw that they suggested that I be the chairman of heroes in Kenya. I thought those people would consider and see what this hero of Kenya can do on this land. I have never been appointed to go to the parliament, I have never been appointed to do any activities. And the people of Kenya are bad, when they know that someone is clever they do not want to give him leadership, they want to kill him. I went through a lot of things; they wanted to kill me because I knew a lot of things. Every Member of Parliament elected from this land is told my secret. Most of the people who were elected from this land they were elected because of tribalism and money. They do not elect a truthful person they elect a liar, thief, and one who is tribal and they go there and deny the other people.</p><p>
That is the reason to why there is a lot of poverty in Kenya. It is because of the people who went there. Some are thieves, liars and people who want to kill people who are speaking the truth. I am 85 years old now and I do not have anything that Kenya did for me. I have made bridges, schools, and roads. I have assisted many people. Some people that I assisted to go the parliament. Some people like Tom Mboya were killed even Ronald Ngala was my close friend was killed. J.M Kariuki was among the people who were killed because of speaking the truth.</p><p>
I may ask where is Kenya heading. What can we do so that we can get out of this lies, these are the things that cause us to become enemies in Kenya. So that the bad things can get out we stay well in Kenya. Those are the things that I am thinking for Kenya. It will be good if Kibaki and Moi that we were together could remember the people that were walking together with them. They are not here, where I am poverty want to kill me and I am still here. </p><p>
