INTERVIEW ON SEVERAL THINGS ABOUT MARAGOLI (A)</p><p>
BY HERMAN MULINYA</p><p>
LAND PARTITION</p><p>
Thank you my name is Herman Mulinya Asava I am from Gahumbwa Gavudia sub-location, Wodanga location, Sabatia District and we are in Vihiga County. I am among those that are standing for the things of traditional culture in maragoli again I am moving around western province the luhya need me in order to learn about the culture. The issues of land at home are many. Today it has defeated many people; they do not know how to partition the land. The land when you have a family the children that you have given birth to you are the one who partition and give them land, you can look for a person that is from your clan or a village elder you be with him and you start partitioning the land. When you say today you have children you have married a wife and you have given birth to children, our traditional culture used to say before a son marries he should first build a hut. And that hat should have one door and they were not putting another door until that son marries a wife. When he has married and he has finished giving birth to children that is when you partition the land and you give him where he can dig. It reaches a time when that son knows the law of the culture that you should not depend on the land that is at home alone the one at home he uses it when he is still young he should also have the argue to look for his own land outside there because when he will be old the children will not be dependent on their grandfathers land; he should have his land outside there where he will share to his children. That land has traditional cultural laws and it should not be a woman who is making it for the children it should be the man who is partitioning and sharing to the children. And those children are there if you had given birth to children out of wedlock those children should be figured out on how they can build a house. Those children are not kept together with the children of the wife who is there; they are kept on the sides or down behind the homestead. Not together with the children that you are having and those children should not build their house in front of your house. If you allow them to build in front of your homestead then you have reduced your life and you will not stay for long. You normally measure your land and the son does it by stepping and then you tell him that is his land. His house that he is in and he should know that he should cook his food. The women makes for him three stones where he will be cooking from. And that land there is a way of measuring it and it should have been blessed. There is something that they plant to show that the land of that son is reaching at a certain point. That child the fence shows that where the father gave him is reaching at that point. The children born out of wedlock can only be allocated land if they are boys. Those were the past days but the government has changed that if the girl has not had a good life where she is staying then she should be given land at where she was born; but long time ago a girl was not given land at home; she was getting married and that is where she was given land. There are laws that are saying that the wife is the land of the soil. The way you are taking care of that soil that is how the wife is also taken care of. When the wife is going to that homestead that is how she is going to get that soil, the children that she gives birth to when she goes there. Those were the issues of the past and how they were partitioning the land they normally want to know where that child was born. When a girl gives birth to a child the child is not given land in that home; he has to go where the father is. If the father is not known he can be given there but be there temporarily and he should not look like the child of that homestead; the respect that you have for that girl is when you impregnate her and she gives birth to a child. And that person should pay for dowry for that girl if she does not have another place, he will stay in that home and you won't throw him because he is a child that your daughter gave birth to</p><p>
When you go for a journey with your wife you should not travel when you have disagreed. She should be the one to pray for you and wish you safe journey. When you are going for that journey your wife should cook for you tea, if it is tea you leave home in peace. When you are leaving home you know the way you are walking. If a snakes moves in front of you then you should not resume that journey, there is bird that sounds like it is singing when it is on the tree, that bird is saying that the journey is not good and if you go for the journey and you meet bad people a dead person, you should not resume the journey; trouble finds you there. When you hear the dead is there you should figure out for a way of passing or you wait they pass and then you continue with your journey and if you are on the road and you stumble your feet you know it is bad luck and that journey is not good, you go back home. Where you are going, that journey that you are going to you go and look for the vehicle that you will get in. sometimes you can get into a vehicle that you have had quarrel hence you won't arrive safely. When you are walking on the road you should travel safely. And if it happens that people are talking on the road you should not walk in the middle of them; those people should be on the sides and you walk on the sides too when you go in the middle of them you normally have bad luck where you are going. Also when you are on the road you greet people; and you be keen about those that you are greeting. And also when you are leaving you should know the type of a child that you gave birth to at first. If your firstborn is a boy and you meet a boy you are lucky, when you meet a woman you then know that journey won't be good. And you should also know if that woman gave birth to a boy first or what. If she gave birth to a girl and you meet a woman you should also know you have met who on the road, the first person you greeted was who, you should not walk in the middle of the people that are seated because they have other issues and if you walk in the middle of them where you are heading you are going to have a bad luck; you should know those people that are on the road they have what. You should also look for the things that you have met and the ones that have walked in front of you; if a snake has passed ahead of you then you know the journey is not good but other things that are speaking when thy pass they do not have anything bad; the journey that you are going to is good. The things that you are seeing down here walking, talking the birds that you are seeing, there are some that have good luck and others have bad luck. Those are the traditional cultures that we have.</p><p>
