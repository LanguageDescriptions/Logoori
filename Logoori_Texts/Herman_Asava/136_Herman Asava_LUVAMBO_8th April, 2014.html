Mulogoli ni mulala ku vandu vamwamu mu lilova na mulala ku vandu va tula Egebeti na ni mulala ku Visiraheli ma kandi ni mulala ku avana va inda ya Nuhu vali vavaga. Hamu, Shem na Japheth. Kunyi valogoli anoho vamwamu kwatula mu inda ya Hamu, mwana wa Nuhu.

Na kuli vandu valangananga baba ni baba wovo wakwivula ligali anoho dada. Mama uyu ni mama wowo wa giligale wa kwivula. Senge ni mbotso baba wovo, amwavo ni amwavo wovo muyayi wa mwivulwa naye anoho mukana. Mbotso uyu ni mwana mukana wa mwivulwa naye, guga ni baba wa baba wovo na mama wovo; ise baba wovo.

Thank you chief Alulu for coming to my home. God is the one doing this. My words would have been lost and there is no one who could tell them better. And I thank this boy a child that I can call my grandson the wise son that God accepted like Solomon to be wise and take the words of this world. I am Herman Mulinya Asava from Gahumbwa, Gavudi sub-location. Wodanga location in Sabatia. Vihiga County in western province. It is a good luck and I want to tell the things about Maragoli, where they came from to this place. There is a problem; our children are not asking where they came from to this place. I want to thank John Lubang'a Lidede from Busali the big house of maragoli. a man who has learnt a lot of things. Maragoli should join us to learn a lot of things. There are old men who have died with 90 years and they do not know the things of maragoli even where the maragoli came from. I am a writer of books and here in maragoli they call me a man who speaks. A person who has spoke here in maragoli, in western province and the whole of Kenya. A man who has fought in politics and also a man who has written a lot of books and they call me a herbalist. They also call me a farmer and a pastor of value in maragoli and they like to learn a lot from me. And I am telling this to the children of maragoli the words that I have written please ask for the people that we were born are how many in the seven or ten clans. The way your clan gave birth. Also ask the girl that you want to marry belongs to which clan. The way the parents have given birth. And this thing will help you wherever you are heading to. These issues Mulogoli had a song that he was doing with a story that was saying:</p><p>
Your father is who? You say Tonde </p><p>
Then they ask you Tonde? Tonde Mang'ure</p><p>
Ah and Mang'ure, Mang'ure ngwegwe</p><p>
Ah ngwegwe, ngwegwe vayanza</p><p>
Ah vayanza, vayanza vagavo</p><p>
Ah vagavo, vagavo ninga</p><p>
Ah ninga, ninga tsatsa</p><p>
Ah tsatsa, tsatsa mmbo</p><p>
Ah mmbo, mmbo kaviri</p><p>
Ah kaviri, kaviri nyambura</p><p>
Ah nyambura, Jibi Masia, kuvakulalu wa masia</p><p>
There are some people here that are called Luo. These Luo are thought to be enemies. A Luo is not our enemy he is ours. The thing that made them to be known as our enemies is because they do not circumcise. But they are the people that we were born with from the same womb. Like Oginga Odinga is from Saniaga clan and many of our people are Saniaga who are covering large part of this land. These people are clever they rule in ways that are wise. It is one of the tribes that I like. That is the reason to why you see we have a boundary with the Luo. Even in Kisumu that is where we were going to look for food. Our market was there. For the Luo many morals are learnt from us and we are also learning a lot from them. Today the Luo know a lot of things that we are behind them. And we have some things for example our people should know where they are coming from. </p><p>
Mulogoli is one of the blacks and one who came from Egypt and he is also among the Israelites. And he is one of Noah's children who were three; Ham, Shem and Japheth. We the Maragoli or the blacks came from Ham's womb the son of Noah. When you read the bible in the book of Genesis 9:20-28 you will find how we came from Egypt to the east and we left our brothers Shem and Japheth. Japheth was the lastborn son of Noah and he was blessed because he had good behaviors. He liked his father Noah and he assisted him in many things. And Ham was lazy and was stubborn to the father. Shem is the elder one of all and our people receive the blessing. We were the servants of Japheth, he ruled over us. A child who obeys the father and mother normally rules over that home. And when you see our people who came and their brothers remained in West Africa others in South Africa, others in Central Africa and others in North Africa. Among them are our black people from Egypt and the Arabs according to the book of Genesis 9:20-28. We were the servants of those people. Japheth was a white man and Shem was a Hindu he is a black and the firstborn child that Noah gave birth to. Shem is the second born. And we are saying this that if you are a person who can ask about the culture and listen to your father and mother you will receive many blessings than other children and you receive good leadership. For the maragoli we have many clans that have come here. And our people should know these clans well. You shuld know they are who and who the way Mr. Lidede has said about the issues of circumcision and culture our people should learn them and know them too. When you see the way we call each other or the issues of age-group. The firstborn gave birth to a boy and the boy given birth by your son is your grandchild. </p><p>
Your grand son gives birth to your great grandson and your great grandson gives birth to great great grandson. And the way people call father it is your father who gave birth to you and this mother is your real mother who gave birth to you. Aunty is the sister to your father. A brother is the boy that you were born together or a girl. A sister is the girl that you were born together. Grandfather is the father to your father and mother. Grandmother is the mother to your father and mother. A cousin is the child of your aunt. Nephew is the child of your sister. Uncle is the brother to your mother. Brother in law is the husband to your sister. </p><p>
Father in law is the father to the girl that you have married and you paid dowry. Brother in law is the one that you paid dowry with because he is the one who brought this girl. But she is the wife to your son or the man who has married the girl is grandmother. Parent in law is the one who gave birth to your children that have intermarried; the boy and the girl. Your parents are the ones calling each other parents in law. The brother to your grandfather you call him grandfather. The sister to your grandmother you call her grandmother. The one who has married the sister to your mother you call him father. The brother to your father you call him father. The grandson to your grandfather you call him grandfather and he calls you grandson. The grandmother to your wife is also your grandmother. The grandmother to your father is your grandmother. The grandfather is also your grandfather. An orphan is the one who has no parents. And you take her as one of your children and you cannot take her as your wife because she has come to stay with you.</p><p>
You were counted together hence you should not make her your wife. And an age set is the one that you have been circumcised with together. You are getting each other well, that is your age set. And he is not more than your brother; when you are together you cannot marry his daughter or your child cannot marry his daughter. He is a close person. The house that you have entered and remarried a widow they say you have married a widow. The children that you give birth to when they grow they are not given the opportunities to pray for people or leading a clan and if it is a boy he doesn't built his house directly in the homestead compound he builds it behind. When you have given birth with a widow and you hear another man has died do not go and sleep with the widow that he has left you will bring something bad. And a bad person has bad hands hence he should not rule. Like our leadership here in Kenya has big problems because the people who are ruling are the ones who got it in tricky ways and those are the things that the culture is refusing. </p><p>
A stepchild is the child that the father gave birth to with the mother out of marriage. He was not brought home and if he is a boy he was building his house aside from your house and he was not elected as a leader. A child that your wife comes with does not build in your homestead they look for him a land somewhere else because he is a child that your wife came with. You do not know if he gave birth with a relative or how he gave birth. When you put that child together with your children he normally finishes the whole of the homestead. When a man sleeps with another man that is an abomination and he should get out of that clan because a man is not supposed to sleep with another man the way things have started happening in this world. The people who are sleeping with their animals and children; this is something that has started happening in this world. They are bad behaviors that we do not want to happen in this world. And that abomination is the one that is causing many people to move away some go to Nandi and you find these issues have brought problems and where these people are going that thing has to follow them. You find the villages that he has gone to his children and grandchildren have done the same thing. </p><p>
The issues of the culture should be told to people to try and learn the things of the past and the good things that they should follow and they will help them. And a widow does not leave the homestead and walks here and there. She can spend one year at home and you are not supposed to argue with her until you remove the cloth on her head while you are arguing, she will leave a bad curse on you. And when you remarry a widow you should know that you are using which door and they should have confirmed that you are the one belonging to the clan and you are going to take care of that homestead. You should not enter the house of the husband of the widow who died and you should not use his door. You should change the doors and do not sleep in the bedroom where he was sleeping. You should enter through the backdoor and leave through the same door if you have not discussed on the way forward and you should build a good house for the widow that is new and you will stay in with her. And before you go to that homestead you should know their behavior and you go there once they have done the cultural things. And if you have been hanging with that widow before the cultural things have been done you should not go with her to the house you will be breaking the laws. You should be wise on those cultural practices. And after you have slept with an animal do not eat its flesh that issue returns back to you. Do not drink the milk of that cow because you have slept with it. If you have slept with your girl or a brother has slept with the sister when she gets married she should not go and choose on the cattle to be given.</p><p>
That child has become an enemy in that homestead and you should not walk in that homestead. And when you are sick do not go to where your girl is married and die from there. When you die there it means that you have made a whole in that house and a fine needs to be paid to that home. We have something about the person who has killed himself. When a person has finished killing himself we have great cultural practices about that. If he is a person who has hanged himself on a tree he is not brought to the house, a grave is prepared in advance and that person is just brought and buried in the grave directly. And the relatives should not cry and not offering should be given and then you go and spend it. There is no eating there. And in a house of a widow the woman who goes to sweep inside there is the one who is also a widow. And the woman who is standing behind the widow is a woman who is also a widow. And if you are standing behind a man who has lost his wife should also be the one who has lost the wife too.  </p><p>
Then when the day's come for shaving you shave hence meaning that you have finished those things if it is a week, three or four days you should go and remove that hair by shaving. Showing that you have made a way for that person to go then you begin to walk but not walking in people's houses. And the tools that they have used to dig the grave should be removed from that house. When they have dig the grave the tools that were used should remain in that grave. The water that has been used to clean the hands should be removed the things that have been used to wash hands remains there. Other things that they do is that they find when someone has died then they buy for him new cloths, they dress him in a tie, they put on him shoes, he is kept in a coffin a things that the person is not supposed to be buried with. Because the bible says I came with nothing I will return with nothing. Even those clothes when you waste a lot of money on them, you buy expensive coffin and the traditional way was to dig the grave and then put sticks down there then they put soil on it. </p><p>
Today they look for a very expensive coffin and they cement the grave. It means that when they have cemented the grave they have prevented him from going to heaven, he will not reach there. It says that the one who has returned to the soil should be on that soil. That soil is using that person. Those are the mistakes that people are doing and you the man if you know that you were walking with the wife of the man who has died do not go there to burry him. You have done a mistake and when you leave the place you go and die. Today vehicles are killin people, they take a vehicle to the funeral and the people who have done wrong things get into that vehicle. And God cannot tolerate that it is like when Jonah when he was sent to go and preach somewhere and he tried to hide and the boat that he got in almost killed people and Jonah knew it and he confessed that he was the one with the mistake. Jonah went and fell inside water and a fish swallowed him and he stayed there for three days and the fish kept him outside. Like for me I am from the house of Basuba. </p><p>
And the way I have told you when you inquire the culture of the past I found that this Jonah was a Basuba. And that is the reason to why some of us we Basuba we do not eat a fish. When we eat a fish we should not eat a big fish we should eat the small piece and when a woman has finished giving birth she doe not eat fish. We the Basuba people came from South Africa from the land of Suba. And the way we said when you go to Egypt our people are there. And others have come here. And when you see us saying that the Kikuyu and Kamba are enemies they are not. They are children of one person. One was getting land and they disagree the way I said one moves to another place and the other one remains. Then they go and stay there. For the culture when Moses was bringing the Israelites to this land; God told him that when he is taking them there they should go and learn good behaviors because the laws were broken in Egypt people had started doing things like in Sodom and Gomora that is why you find a man and another man the way it has started here in Kenya and the rest of the world, a man is taking another man as a wife. </p><p>
God is not cheated with such things and that is also the reason to why God brought water to destroy the people and save Noah because people had broken the laws of God. And that is why he told him that he wants to bring water to finish people there. He asked him to take everything in male and female because he wanted to finish this world. God was teaching that the way I am with chief Lidede we want to teach our maragoli people who are in this world we save our people because they are perishing today. The reason to why they are perishing is because we have some who are calling themselves preachers who knows the word of God and yet they are not following those rules. They have turned those rules in churches. They find the women that they are preaching too and make them their wives. They are stealing money form those churches. That is the reason to why Jesus broke the church and removed things that were there and he said that the church had brought bad sin and some got out of that church. We want to teach people our culture so that they change and get out of those bad behaviors. We have some clans the way chief Lidede has said the first house of Mulogoli was Musali then the second boy was Kitsungu. </p><p>
You have heard him saying that a woman came from Bunyore and she gave birth then we had the Kirima and then Mmave and among these people we have two clans that the maragoli have here. We have the Basaniaga and the Basuba, vasanga, vakihayo, vamuku, vayonga, vamasero, vamigango, vatemburi, vamoi, vamuruga, vamenge, vafunami, ng'ang'a, kiguta, damayi, vasagala, mugetsi, vandega, vakuvela, vakisinde, vasalia, salala, vamufwa, vamahero, vavuruge, vadindi, vagisunda, vagisutsa and vaguga. And some of those people like the vagisunda are the ones who came from Bunyore and they had killed, after they had killed they were chased away from there and they said that they should not stay with those people. And there are some who bought land and they saw that it was well for them to go and stay there. We are not saying that all the people who migrated there were bad from where they came from. Others are because of money like some of us who bought land in Lugari because the land here is scarce. We are asking the government if I am one of them who is asking for land from the government Sir Marco Brandel is the white man that allowed Musa Amalemba and I to get land in Lugari where our people went. In Mombasa we have many of our people there like the Mijikenda that you hear there, these are our people from here who have gone there to stay in Taita. Today we have intermarried with the Taita girls and our girls are getting married there too. When you go to Mombasa you will find our names there like Kadenge and when you go to Kamba you will find Konzolo, Musembi and when you go to Meru we have Mbaya and these are our names. I also want to thank our Meru people they are trying to have good behaviors but politics. When we elect a politician he begins to destroy our culture. I will like those clans that we have to come together and promote our culture. They should teach our people so that they do not become confused the way they are.</p><p>
We are here as the people of Vihiga who are Maragoli. we have some sublocations that should be known. Down there we have Madzuu, iviguru, imahanga, kisienya, Ichagenda, lisiola, lideleli, masana, lugaga, maguyi, muhanda, ivunandi, wamuruma, we also have kegoye, chambiti, chukunzila, imbihi, chango, ikumba, kidundu, imanda. When we go to north maragoli we have Kivagala, kigama, wadegula, mudete, mulundu. Na kovola kulatsa kalunu wa inze ndula yinu, koveye ninde igavudia, losengeli, vokoli, igaiyedi, mambai. When we go to the east we have Kirima, imukingi, liaduywa, wademesi. When we go there again we find Munoywa, Bukulunya and Mbale. We also have Isolongo, kisatiru, kegondi, muyundi. When we go to chavakali we find Nondi is there, walodeya is there, iviyalo, evojo, igunga is there. When we go to Busali where our brother who is here comes from we have Tegero, which is there, kedoli, ichavogere is there. When you go to the southern part of Busali you will find ivudaywa is there, ichamakanga is there, ivugina is there and all of these people are of this land. I will also say my history the reason to why I knew these things is because I asked. My name is Mulinya Asava, my father is Asava and the name of baptism is Herman. I was born in 1930 August the day of harvest on a Saturday in the evening at 5 o'clock. I was born a young child and I didn't have good clothes. We were seven children. A girl was only one and my father was called Asava, his father was called Ambunya. My mother was called Rubai Vinaywa Mudemi. The woman who gave birth to me was a mmasero girl and her mother had taught her good behaviors to pass on to her children. I am from Basuba clan and my father was called Jaika Asava. And the father to Asava is Ambunya and the father to Ambunya is Lodende and the father to Lodende is Anzala and the father to Anzala is Tsivi, and the father to Tsivi is Kisisi, and the father to Kisisi is Musuva. My mother is vinaywa mudeminye a mmasero munyunga girl. My mother was the daughter of Mulinya Vielitsa. Vielitsa was the child of Mugoywa and Mugoywa was the child of Mbowo. Father died in the year 1933 while I was growing and I was still a young child. And I started knowing those things while I was still a young child. </p><p>
We are saying this; that we should learn many things while we are still young and we teach our children, our grandchildren and they will teach others these things. The way we are walking here. I also want to say other things the way you have said God has called you. I am a farmer of many types of feed. I like planting food that people can use food that has good values. Traditional vegetables should be used in large quantity. The traditional food should be consumed like the wheat, cassava, millet and potatoes and we should use them. I have reared bees here and other people do not know anything about bees. God gave wisdom to bees among all the things that people are keeping in their houses. Even if you are keeping hens, birds or cows these things have more wisdom than we people who are keeping them. When you hear a cow mowing you should know if it needs a bull or it has not eaten well, or it wants to be milked or it wants a certain type of feed. When it is mowing it is calling you to go and see what it wants. And once you have known it then you go and keep it well. Even the birds and the hens that you are seeing have good behavior. Cows have good behaviors and they have overtaken we people who are keeping them. When a cow sees that you are not treating it well it will step on you and kill you. That is when you hear that a cow has killed someone but when you take good care of it won't kill you. But if you do not take good care of it, you deny it food, when you do not know the things about a bull the things about a cow it normally does the same to you. We have something called bees I have kept them here nearly 50 beehives. With the hives the bees are not stinging anyone here because I know well about keeping bees. And when you take good care of these bees they are very clever, they go and call other bees that are in Kamba and they come all the way from Kamba to this place. They go and call others from Mombasa and they come here. They do not want anyone to go and make noise from there or dig a ditch there it means you have looked down upon them. They want you to respect them and they will also respect you like my bees here have defeated many people. I tried calling the Agricultural people to come and harvest honey for me they came during daytime, the bees were almost finishing cows and other people. But the bees that I am keeping I went to specialist like me of the culture in Nandi. They started at 8AM and finished at 1PM and the bees didn't sting anyone. They do not sting those people too. </p><p>
Then they left and at 2PM the bees were already in the hive. And what I want the maragoli to know is that the bees have good luck, it has been written in the book of Psalm like for the honey people are using many people are using my honey as a specialist of honey. People like that honey unlike the honey from other people because other people do not know anything about honey. We have three types of bees; the ones that are on the soil down, others on a tree and others in a hive. There are others that are making honey and they do not sting anyone. And this honey is a medicine of cough, or chest pain. They heal ton soles. It heals stomachache when you have diarrhea. It heals when you have had an accident; it brings your body parts together. There is some content that is removed in it and given to a person who has had accident and he gets healed quickly. It protects one from bad eye. It assists in terms of culture. In agreements if you want to agree on something, maybe if you had disagreed on something. After you have agreed you normally take honey and then it seals the agreement. It helps one to look young and that is why you can see I have 85 years and I walk for long distance and one does not feel hungry. It is helping to hold your body parts and you look like a new person. This honey heals a woman who has given birth and helps her not to give birth to a heavy child. And when she gives birth she gives birth to a child of value. When a woman is using it when she gives birth she gives birth to a good child. A child that has been born walks very fast if you are adding honey to her porridge or tea, she walks after a short period of time. </p><p>
It helps a child to talk after a short period of time and the words that she speaks are of value and are heard well. It helps a child's eyes to see very far and she will never buy spectacles. I help a child not to have worms in the stomach and it also protects her. It prevents blindness. It helps those that have sores and also those that have disagreed the way I have said above. When you walk with energy people wonder. Honey gives you that energy when you use honey you get children that are healthy and after six months your wife is ready to give birth, she gives birth and the child grows she walk and talks well. Honey helps you to walk over a long distance and it helps you not to get tired very easily the way I have said. When you use honey it has been written in the book of Proverb you should not find when you have been told to use honey you go and use it in large quantity it will cause you problems. You use little and it will help you and you should know how it is going to help you. Today we have herbs; there are some when you plant them at home they prevent enemies from getting there. Those trees have more medicine that is the reason to why the children of Egypt were told that there are many trees that they are going to use. I am very sad when I see in our Kenya people are going to the forests and destroying them. They are destroying by cutting the things that were there. They were of value. God is the owner of the forest. The rain that you are seeing, the things that you are seeing we have three things or four things; we have sun, moon, stars, cloud, hills, forests, lakes and the rain cannot rain if it has not asked permission from the lake. </p><p>
After it has asked permission from the lake the hills and the forests are also informed that the rain is coming. When you are clever you look at the hills and you predict that the rain is coming. We have something that we call the water or the river that you see. At the river if the water had disappeared and you go there in the morning and see it coming down then you know that the rain is near. When the land is dry and you walk outside and see fog on the grass in the morning then the rain is near. When the wind was blowing form east then the rain was heading towards the lake when they have agreed then the wind blows it means that they have agreed and it is going to rain. Then they ask the hills to be ready. We have birds if the rain had lost then many birds come you then know that they have been told that rain is coming and they should inform people. We also have frogs, when you hear a frog making noise then you know that it is coming to rain. We have small insects like ants they have more wisdom than us and they know that it is going to rain. When you are the one that God chose like the prophets then you see those things with your eyes. I have a gift that God gave me and some people do not have. The state in which people are made with their heads, their eyes, their mouth, their walk and the way they put on. I know these things and when you ask me I will say that this person is like this. There are some books that I had written I have shown the way a person is and a person with such condition should not be given any activity even one to perform. We have a condition like for a man who has breast. The ass that is big, such a person is rejected by the culture and he cannot become a parent. And he should not be given a chance to do anything in the culture. Or a person who has a growth at the back should not be given any opportunity to lead any cultural activity. God has refused such people. Then we have some in our churches they have different hats and the women put one different pieces of clothe on the head. You look at the way she has put it on that cloth shows that her behaviors are not good. You can see the book is torn and the person with a broken arm should not be given any opportunity to lead or perform any cultural activity. A lame person should not be given an opportunity to lead anything because he is lame. When you see someone who has a long chin that person has different behaviors. They are not good. </p><p>
We have some people that have grey hair that is why you see a magistrate putting on a hat that is grey; this person should have good behavior because grey hair is a honor from God. And a person that has bald on the head the laws of God have refused him. He doesn't have good behaviors; he has behaviors that God has refused. A person with a long chin the laws do not allow him; he is a tricky person and also greed. When you see a person who has long beard, inside him there are bad behaviors. You watch him and the reason to why he has left long beard. He doesn't know why he left the beards to be long. He just sees that he has left the beards but they make him to have bad behaviors. The way I have said we have some hats that people put on and when we meet a person I can tell you the type of behaviors that he has. People are putting on hats and there are women who are putting on pieces of clothes on their heads that are not of good behaviors. She becomes harsh and she cannot agree with the husband. She cannot even agree with other people. She has a lot of arguments. In these churches we have some men who are putting on hats like the people of divine, Israel, Revival they are putting on their hats and you will find that they have arguments. Today when you see someone putting on the Israel's hat his coat is facing the other side. It shows that the behaviors have changed and they are not good. That is when you find someone has long beards and he is calling himself a pastor. A child with a big head doesn't have good behaviors. When you see some women with big hips, inside them they do not have good behaviors. For all of these things when God has blessed you, learn a lot of things then you see how you can teach other people. The way they should live. </p><p>
And a person is supposed to be the way we are saying. Our people who are elected as the members of parliament should take us as the elders sons of Mulogoli we people that are here and then we look into the behaviors of that person we can tell you the person who deserves leadership. But with the leadership of today, someone who has money is the one who bribes people and then he is given leadership. He goes to do bad things there and you find that your area is not good because you elected someone who has behaviors that are not good. We should be keen on the people who are praying for people even the pastors are of which type. His behaviors are like this and he is a parent or disabled, whether he has a wife or not, if he has a house. And this house that you are seeing us saying is the house of a woman. A house has three things, an indicator, supporter then a woman remains. In this house we have three cooking stones. A person who cooks on the cooking stones is a woman. You should not go to cook when you have a wife. These cooking places are of three types. There is a man, a wife and a child. Up above we have the sun. The sun is a man, and the wife is the moon and the children are stars. </p><p>
And for a woman God gave her this thing and she said that she has gone for her period. She doesn't have a ladder to go to the moon but you will hear her saying that she has gone for her periods. That period means that the child that she will receive will come from the moon. The respect of a woman is on the moon and of a man is on the sun. For man you should have you agendas as long as you are well you should bring something for your wife to eat. A woman should not look for food that you are going to eat. We have trees; men are the ones who are supposed to plant trees. We have graves; a woman should not dig a grave, a man is the one who is supposed to dig a grave. And a man who is digging that grave should be one with good morals. If a person has died and he had given birth to children the person who digs the grave should be one who has children also and is also good. But a bad person who is moving up and down should not go and dig that grave. And people of that clan dig that grave. A person buys a cow used for the ritual from that clan. And that person who goes to buy the cow he has to check if it has horns because the person who has died is a person who has also given birth. He looks if it has all the legs, with all the udders. </p><p>
Someone has to go and buy a cow for the rituals to be done. A ritual for a man a bull is bought that is a man. And that bull is slaughtered in the morning at 6AM not in the evening. It was slaughtered at the grave for the dead person to use the blood. If you have done mistakes in that home then you are going to the place where they have slaughtered the cow then you are in problems. That cow that has been slaughtered if you had done mistakes in that home do not eat it, if you eat you should know that you are going to get out of that place with a bad revenge. A woman that is supposed to tie a cow for dowry should be one who has been paid dowry or a person who has paid dowry for the wife but one who has not paid dowry should not go to tie a cow for dowry. A person who is praying for people should be a man who has given birth to children. A person with one eye the laws are refusing him, a person with one arm the laws are refusing him. The cow for dowry should be bought three days earlier.</p><p>
When it has been brought home it should not be tied in the house. It should stay outside and graze from outside then it will be slaughtered and people who will pray should be from that clan. A person who is leading the ritual should be one who does not have debt at his home. He has finished his. He should be a person who has his family well. The things about the legs and the head of a cow; there some people who carry the head of the cow and they take it to their homes. It should be made from there, after they have finished the ritual then the people of that home should prepare the meat on the head and it should be used from there. And the people who want to be given meat and other parts of the stomach should be women from that clan and who are coming from near. We have problems the way I said people are hanging themselves they are really killing themselves. You find that offering has been given and taken to that house. The people who killed that person might have given the offering and you are going to spend it. </p><p>
There are others those that have that thing are given part of the money and it normally gets back to you. That is the reason to why they refused offering to be given and food should not be eaten where someone has been killed. We have a problem today that we say love the dead. Our people today do not get in agreement with that person they have done bad things then he comes with money and offer it there. Politicians have found the sacred places like church where we were worshiping they come with their words to the funeral a place that doesn't need lies. That person that has died is listening to those things and you are going there and speaking lies. That is the reason to why you hear some people are going away, when you heard one of our MP left and he died. Khaniri had some things that caused to him to get to that problem. The funeral that you are attending you should know it is which type of funeral that you are attending. You should know what is there. When you have gone there and you had done bad things there you will not get home, you will perish while on the way. We have another thing; the water that we are drinking. We should go and inquire type of water that we are drinking is coming from where. At the river they go and check where good water is then they go and fetch that water from there.  </p><p>
These trees that I have planted are the ones that people are using to hold water and today they are not there. They had good leaves for fetching water and the water had medicine that was healing the village and chasing away bad things. Today these trees are not there. Today we have something for example women are slaughtering hens. The laws are refusing that a woman should not slaughter a hen. We have a pot for cooking in chicken. The maragoli have a proverb that two cocks are not cooked from one pot meaning that two men are not sharing one woman. Women can be married even ten or hundred but one woman cannot marry two men in one house, one man is the one who is with that woman. And for the women they do not have a desire of having many husbands. </p><p>
If you have two, three or five wives they love each other and stay together as they assist each other with the activities in good ways. But for men when you share a woman on the first day you begin fighting and you want to kill each other because men are jealous. We want our people to learn these things and know them well. We have something that has arisen today in women that is bad; dressing badly and walking badly. Dressing and walking badly the government has started addressing that issue. Women are dressing badly and God made a woman to cover her nakedness because that place is dangerous. That is the reason to why people are raping children and it is because of looking at the nakedness of a woman. A woman should hide her nakedness even to her children. And if her daughter was not seating well the people in the past used to ask her not to show her nakedness. This nakedness the way God made a woman he knew that is a sacred place where we came from and our eyes should not be looking there again. </p><p>
You are a clever person to know that and a woman should sit well and know that she has sat well. The way women used to eat in the past is not the same way that the women eat today. When a woman was sitting to eat food, she used to sit well and eat until she finishes. Today women eat while their legs are open. That thing is bad and it is not good. We had something called "itiru" in a house where they were keeping beer and then they say that beer is there for people to drink. That beer is for the culture. If you had done bad things in that home then you go and drink that beer, you are finished. As I have said women do not dig graves. That pot was an indication of a woman meaning that men do not share one woman. We have "emondo" when you hear that long time they shared "emondo" it means that two men shared one woman. I told one woman from south maragoli who asked me the word "emondo" that I had written meant what. I told her that when she goes to bath in the evening on that day she should remove her clothes and bath well and she should not put on clothes but look carefully at the front part of her body.  </p><p>
You will see that it is looking like "emondo" that woman ringed me and she told me that she had seen wonders; she had seen that her body is like "emondo" and she asked me where I saw such things. I told her and south maragoli women like my words when I go there I teach them and they hear well. A woman has been given her duties; I have books that I have written showing that a woman has her activities and a man has his too. A woman does not tie a cow for dowry. A man is the one who ties it. A woman does not buy a cow for dowry. Men of that clan buy a cow for ritual. There are many things that we want our people to learn and know. </p><p>
To wind up I have some cultural practices that I have written you will take to the white man my friend to read it. After you have read you give the white man to read and know the words that I have here. If possible as I am with this man he can invite us, he invite John and me we go there in order to come out of this poverty that we are in. We are having a prayer if he can prepare us a way to visit America and spend one week there. The way I said one time for those American it is I who visited Mboya and asked him to go and talk to the Americans to come and give us government. Mboya went to speak with the Americans then they went and spoke with the Europeans and that is when we got the government. Mboya liked me, Ronald Ngala who stood for our constitution it is me who proposed him and then he went to be our spokesman in Lancaster House. For me in Kenya the MPs that I was sharing with in the past didn't want to leave me they liked me most. I was like the president of Western province. Even Jeme Nyagah there is no MP who wanted to leave me. </p><p>
Even the white men who were here like Harvlock liked me with their whole heart. They were coming here until I help them with many ideas. I will like this white man if he is a good child the way I saw him talking to me while you were with him here, my heart felt that he had like me and there are many things that he wants to do for us. And the things that he will do that are good will come from you the way you will walk and come to see us from this side. The way you are walking and visiting us here and the way we are talking with you is the one that is causing Mike to love us. He should prepare a way and give us help from the poverty that we are having. Then I get a chance on the things that we are talking we write good great books. We should also have pictures with him and he writes for us good words about the government of America and the government of Kenya. Because Kenya is sleeping and it doesn't know people like me. I was among those that fought for this nation, I was arrested and the government doesn't know me. It has forgotten me, today when someone goes there they are afraid that their secret of this nation will be revealed.</p><p>
I will like these things to be good that white man to assist us; we can even hold our cultural event with our people from this place here. One that is different from the one done at Mbale. And people wonder where we have found these people. Even when he invites us to America I take people of value from here like this man of value that I am with here. I call him my child because he is not my age mate. But when I did my activities he is the one who knew. I am the first African manager of hotels for tourists. I am one whom the white man were relying on and they heard my issues and I had different activities but the government that is there cannot recognize who I am and that is the reason to why I am with this man. When you ask this man about my history he can tell you at length and that is the reason to why I went to call him all the way from Busali to this home here and you have heard his words at length here and they will help you. He has many words and I have others the way we are talking we are making our church and there is no one who can interfere.</p><p>
We are making our church and we are together. You saw the day that you were here nobody interfered with us. Some people have started asking why are we not inviting them. People are really talking but we want to make a church where people will come. The things that we are saying the phone and the songs are good we look for singers that are good and the tools for singing. It will be a day of surprise. That is what I thought that it is good to have that day MR. Alulu you stand with us. God to lead us and we shall pray for blessings upon you. You are a young child but the things that you have done are great and we want other children to learn and they follow and say that Alulu is the one who said these things. Where did you get these skills? The white man Mike is the one who recommended you and said that he is a good child that you will work with. Then he told me that you would be coming here often to take my words and send to him. I believe what I have spoken are many the way Mr. Lidede has said they are words that you cannot finish in one day. There are many that have remained but what we have spoken God to bless them to go and do work well. Thank you and May God bless you for all. </p><p>
