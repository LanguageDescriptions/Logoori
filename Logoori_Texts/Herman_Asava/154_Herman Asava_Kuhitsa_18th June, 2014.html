INTERVIEW ABOUT SEVERAL THINGS IN MARAGOLI (B)</p><p>
BY HERMAN ASAVA</p><p>
HUNTING</p><p>
Hunting long time ago they had dogs that were taught how to hunt and they used to go and hunt. That dog was trained well and you who were going with them you used to have some of the weapons that walked with; spear, or a good sword that you go with that dog and when you left the house you had good clothes that you were putting on when you go to hunt. And when you go to hunt those things like rabbit or other things there are some animals that you can kill for eating. And other animals you were killing them because they were causing trouble by killing people. We had other like chimpanzee; those things had defeated dogs and the dog that you were going to hunt with a reasonable dog, a dog that has been trained many things. And that dog when you are going for hunting you see the way it was walking on the road and smelling on things. When it smells on things you know that dog has found something that it wants to kill. And when you have finished killing someone begins to shoot because you were not going there one person to hunt; you were many people who were going there. You can leave from here and you go very far away like at Kisaa or wherever where you are going to hunt for a certain animal. When you have killed that animal then you figure out how you can slaughter and bring it. And there are things like the skin that we were getting out of it you could make a skin for putting on. And the first person who used to shoot that thing and it dies or others kill it, that person was given the head, part of the body and the back. Another person cannot take that meat if he has not shot it; the first person to shoot that thing even if he has not killed it but he has shot it first, when other people go and kill that thing. You were the one who was given that meat that I have said; the head, part of the body and the back when you go with meat at home when the people there see you going to hunt, they normally sing good songs for you to show that this one knows how to hunt well. And they say that the hunter is praised by the river. A hunter cannot be praised if he has not killed that animal; he has to kill that animal in order to be praised well so that if the skin was removed he will be given and also given a meat to go and roast from home and eat. If a hunter was good people used to call you and you go for that hunting you go and count those things. And there were many bad fierce things that had terrified people from going to hunt. They wanted them to know that the person who is hunting should have an arrow, spear, a sword and you also have a skin that you are putting on in most cases that thing can come to bite you; if you didn't have those weapons you were not going for hunting if you were many you used to go to the forest that has many different animals even the chimpanzee. And reaching a chimpanzee and killing it was not easy because it has behaviors like a human being. And then we have what we call elephant cheetahs and other different things that can hurt people. If you are a person who knows war well you normally kill those things and if you do not know how to fight well those things that kill you and then you find that someone has died while there; the animals have killed him while over there. And that forest when you are going there you should be keen; you know that those things move and they hide on a tree. When you are going there and you do not know something gets off from the tree and falls on you and it wants to finish you. And there were other things that were going in holes. If you have not jumped well that thing can go to the hole and get out and you when you are walking you are not seeing behind and it can come and eat you. Those things want when you go there you go when you know them and you should also have known things about the herbs. In case that thing bites you when you have gone there, you know the type of herb that you can use on the things that have bite you and then you also have herbs that can scare those things from following you. A hunter was a person who was really praised; he had his fierce dogs that can make you to get mad. And then you should have the thing for hitting to show that you were hunting and the people will know that you are hunting and the people on the other side will prepare themselves if they delay that thing will come from there and kill one person among them and eat him. The hunting had many issues and people were leaving very early to go for hunting, they were not going in the evening. They were going very early in the morning to hunt. And the thing can run for a long time and you just follow it until you find and kill it. </p><p>
DEATH OF AN INITIATOR</p><p>
A person who was initiating initiates when he died at the burial it were the fellow initiators who were burying him and they were putting on the clothes that they were using when they were circumcising people. And when that initiator is going to be circumcised they have to do some cultures like sing while they burry him. The way they were burying him in that grave it was not similar the way other people are buried, that one is buried with a lot of respect, in that grave and he should be on the sides. When they cover the grave they cover with a lot of respect like a person who was initiating. And the tool that he was using to sing with they have to sing many songs in order for that person to go well. And the sticks that they had they had to have them, they hit down when they go to burry that dead person. Another person who has not initiated cannot burry that person because he does not know how they burry. But the people who initiate are the ones who are called and told to go and burry that person, as they sing for him the initiation songs and play the things that they were using form initiation. If possible before they bury that person they have to walk on the road, if they are going to bury him they will walk on the road and sing those songs and then they bury him, as they show people that the real man who was an initiator has died. When it will be time to bury they are the ones who do it, again when they have buried they will go on the road and begin to sing in their costumes to show that they have buried their person. And if there is food they will go to eat from the house of the dead person who was an initiator. They cannot go to eat from outside. And those things that they are using for circumcision will be on that grave the whole night and then they will remove them from there the following morning. They do not remove them immediately until the following day.</p><p>
When you are going for example to preach or do a traditional activity, or to baptize a child, naming a child, they do not allow you to be there with your wife. They do not allow they say if you go and get into those things you are going to bring a bad luck. And that activity will not happen well. Even the initiator when we say he is going to circumcise the children he does not sleep with his wife on that day; they look for a house for him or a person who does not have a wife, or a person who has elder people; he sleeps there until he finish his circumcision that is when he will return to his house. And these things are disturbing many people. When you have cultural activities avoid you wife and do not go and share a bed with her when you are going for those activities because they are traditional and they do not allow you to share a bed with your wife and then you go and work on them. They were also avoiding quarrelling with a person when you are going to do an activity. And you should not greet people anyhow; you leave very early in the morning even if a person wants to greet you just use the mouth and do not stop to talk with her; you go there silently if you know you are going for those activities. And the person who was circumcising had something that we call grasshopper. After he has finished and given that grasshopper he had something that he kept in and then he goes to eat and he was not eating with his children, he will go and eat with that man that he was staying with in that house. A person the way I have told you about land partitioning or if you have been invited to go and show a person where to build a house you should not have slept with a woman. The culture was refusing a person who didn't have a baby or one who is impotent. Even the initiators a person who is impotent cannot circumcise people, a person with breasts does not circumcise, a child born out of wedlock cannot do such activities; they were refusing these people. Again if a person was lame they were not allowing that person to do such activities. Until they look for a good person and then they appoint him to do those practices. </p><p>
When a person has been bereaved be it a wife or a husband, the person who will take care of you and you stand with should also be a widow. If it is a man he is given a man who lost the wife too so that he stands with him through all those things, again if it is a woman she is given another woman who lost the husband too so that she stands with her through all those things. In that house the person who will be washing things will be a woman, if it a man it is also a man who does that. And there are some bad things that our people do these days, they find an elder person and they look for a young person and they say that he go and bury him or stand and speak about him or he carry and go to bury him in the grave; it was not like that; if it is an elder person it should be an elder person too who goes to bury him and read the laws. And if you are a person with different behaviors who is not from that clan you should not go and bury that person; he was buried by the people of that house and clan. And it is not his father or brother but the people of his clan. They take two people and the chief can come to assist but on burial it is strictly the clan members. And when the person is taken from the veranda now they want to go and bury him they have to see how that dead person is; they confirm his body and dick if it is okay, maybe he is dressed in a tie and shoes; he should not be buried with those things. He should be buried without those things and they cover him if he is empty. When people have seen that he is okay that is when they bury him. If she is a woman other women are the ones who go to see if she is okay. If she has things that she had tied on the waist they are removed or if they are on the neck, if a man has a tie or anything they are all removed. You should not be buried with the pant/boxer, even the shoes. Those people check they check the person who has died and then they go and bury him in the grave. The way I have said if you are a person with bad behaviors, impotent, a lame person; you will not go to bury the dead if he was a person who had given birth. And if it is a young baby who has died the women are the ones who go to burry in the banana plantation. If a person has died and he is not from that homestead he is not buried straight in that homestead, he is buried down near the river because he does not have a homestead. If you bury him in the homestead he will come back to you and finish all the people in that homestead. When the dead dies the luhya people seat together and they find out how that person has died, if he killed himself, has taken poison; there are cultural practices that are done on him. That one is not kept outside the house for some days or taken to the house he is taken direct to the grave from the tree where he killed himself. And the people who go to bury him when they have buried that person they do not sleep in their houses; they have to go and sleep outside. The clothes that they had they have to change and leave them at another place they should not enter with them in their house. And the people who have buried the person who has killed himself they are given something and they do not get with it into their house; they eat it while outside and then they get into the house without anything and they sleep until tomorrow. And the people who are there they sing the whole night to make that person to go well and then they leave the following day. There is a cultural rule followed when you are digging a grave there are people who are changing them. If it is in maragoli the person who has died they bury him with the head facing north because they say our people came from Egypt to this place; the head to face there and the buttocks to face east. The Tiriki have changed they bury with the head facing east but ours was like that. </p><p>
The issues about land where you go to buy you inquire first the way I told you a land is a woman and it is the same thing. When you go to buy you should ask why the owners are running away and why are they selling the land. If it is a land that people have killed themselves or have perished, you have to ask maybe those people stole the land and it was not theirs. When they get there they realized that they have perished and they run away and sell the land. You come from there and you say that you have found a land to buy and maybe that land people have perished on and it brings you problems. And when you will say that you want to build your house on that land you should know where you are building. You may be building on a grave where people died long time ago. The person that you are building your house on who died you find that he has returned to your house, the children that you give birth to in that homestead perish because you have built your house on a grave. There are some lands that people run away from them when they have difficulties they say they are going away. And some kill one another in a homestead and it happens that if you are from one family and you have killed you cannot stay together; you normally leave there. And at the tree where the person has killed himself from they normally cut those trees and they burn them. The people that bury that dead are supposed to be given something that they are given. And when they go with that thing even if it is a hen they do not get with it to the house; you have to go and throw in the river, forest, and other things from the forest to eat; you should not go with those things to the house they can cause you problems. And the ropes that the person used for hanging himself they normally throw them away or they burn them they should not be in the house. Even those hoes do not get into the house; if possible those things can be kept somewhere else outside there they should not stay in the house. And the people clean themselves with that water, they should draw it from the river and they clean themselves with it; it should not come out of the house. It should come from the river they bath and they go. For the person who has hanged himself or drunken poison, people who bury him are from far and not from near or from the clan. If it is a person from Idako you normally call people from Idako or Tiriki to come and bury that person. When they bury the person and leave they should not get straight into their house. Those are the things of those moments. About the issues of the land do not rash and say that you have found land you inquire first why is the owner selling the land. Again the way I have said about the issues of a woman; when you go to marry a wife you ask about the lady and know the behaviors of the people where she is coming from, you can marry a wife whom bad things have happened at their home. Maybe the father has slept with her or someone else, when you marry the wife you say that you have married the wife and when you want to give birth to children that thing returns her; the children that she gives birth to start doing the same thing again. If people killed each other you find the children that she has given birth to are also doing the same. When you want to marry a wife you inquire about the behaviors of her home; how they were and how they grew, how were their grandfather because it is written in the bible; the sins of the father are keeping it on their children and when it goes to the children and they are not made and the people are alive they hide in order for their child to go and bring them wealth again where that girl get married she should not be paid dowry to bring back to that home; that girl should go away and look like an enemy to that home; she should not come back to that home. And you the boy who did that you should pay a fine and you should not return to that home or anything should not come from that girl and you eat. For a girl who has finished doing such behaviors, they were not bringing dowry to that homestead, where she is married should not be known; she should go away and get lost from that village. And when you want to marry a wife you go and find out where she has come from, you also go and visit her parents, you know if they are alive, how is their culture hence you can now marry that girl. And if you see that wife to be yours and you feel that she is yours you should have paid the dowry and the people who are there do come and they see the cattle when you have spoken about the dowry, you look at the cattle and the cow for dowry should not have a broken tail, or a foot or one eye. If it is a bull it should have its ass, if it is a female cow it should have its entire udder. All these things have a cultural law that we should follow. If these people came and found that a brother had slept with the sister, that girl was taken away from that home for her not to be in that homestead. And that boy was warned and he was not staying there well. And where the girl has gone she was to go forever and she was not allowed to step in that homestead; they were chasing her away from that home. And if they had given birth to a child the people in the past used to kill that person they go and throw her in the river because she is born between relatives; they didn't like the child to suck milk from her mother. The parents if she had done that, in some luhya communities they had to pay fine even if it is a cow, it be open that the child has been known to have disobeyed the laws. And he was not given leadership or asked to pray for someone; that one was prevented because of the thing that he had done. They had something that they were calling a pot. That pot they used to put it on top of the house to show that these people have married and they were relatives. That thing was traditional and it was preventing perishing of people there; in order for that thing not to get back to those people; long time they had the sign.</p><p>
DEVELOPMENT DONE BY ASAVA</p><p>
Development that I brought here in maragoli was more I did many things while I was still in politics; the issues about the road, bridges, schools, I struggled because schools were not doing well here and our people here were not offering loan; black people are not having loans. I assisted them by asking the government on their behalf and it started giving black people loans. People who had vehicles here like this bus they did not have something called TLB. TLB was given to the Hindu and the white men; people who had vehicles here. I fought until they got these things. There was no political position here the person who had been W. W. Awori and was ruling the whole of western province, when he left Masinde Muliro took over that seat. Masinde Muliro was strong person and I was with him when they expanded western province and I assisted Musa Amalemba I assisted him to do campaign and he got that seat. When Amalemba got the position he assisted me and we left maragoli and we got a white man by the name Sir Marco Brandel we got land at Lugari and Amalemba assisted me until a political seat was found in Bunyore that Kasakala eventually took over, others were found in Tiriki and we the Maragoli were the last one to get. Otiende took over that position. And I have walked here for a long time teaching about the culture, about the culture and the issues of politics, even the position of a chairman of council our white people are the ones who called DC and is the one that they call council. And I struggled and the development of the location or the district was on the council, we had to look for a person who could take the position of a councilor. They did that and we got the seat of a councilor here. I also went to Kakamega and I assisted there, hospital of Kakamega was not functioning, I assisted them and the hospital began to work. The road from Kisumu to Kakamega had just been dug by the White men and I helped people to be paid well and the road was established, the shops that were in Majengo and Mbale they were paid well. I welcomed many people here, the MPs of that time, the White men and other black people like Oginda Odinga, Tom Mboya, Ronald Ngala and other politicians that were here; they had respected me. I was among the one that advised people to go to the Lancaster House, I was the advisor who sent Mboya, to go to America. The one called Sir Saco Marshall was the adviser of our people who went to Lancaster House who gave them advice on how to get that seat. When Kenyatta was from prison, I was the one who went to pray for Kenyatta Kakamenga he had come there and people had refused him on the radio. But I assisted the Governor and the PC and they accepted. It was I who prayed for Kenyatta when he came here. And our people who were the politicians knew the work that I was doing, I moved here as their advisor. The one that I was working well with was Navwera he respected me well. And Otiende is old and he is at home. People wanted to kill me because I know many things here in Kenya here we have one thing that says if you are a truthful person and not a person of lies, if you are not a thief; our people do not want you. I was working here and even the position that people wanted to kill me I didn't get it; Mudavadi didn't want the Vamave to get the political position. I struggled here and I helped the Vamave to get the political position. They wanted to kill me because I gave the Vamave the political seat even when I got the position of a councilor I had trouble because they didn't want me to the councilor here because I will go and take a position in the parliament. They prevented me and they cause d a lot of problems to me, people that were following me, they were sent here to come and kill me and it was Kibisu. He took other people who came with him. And it was I who assisted Kibisu when Otiende left the political seat and Kibisu took over. There is a proverb that says a stamp makes you to make it. The bad thing about the people that I was assisting they were betraying me and they wanted to kill me. Even when I took Kibisu to the court and the government refused to arrest him is because the government had sent him, Moi is the one who sent Kibisu through Mudavadi, because he knew my name was here and it was high. Even on farming I was at a high position in farming. They saw this person because PC was coming here, the white men came here and they stayed and learned about farming here, they learnt about other things. They were wondering how the white men were coming to the home of this person and he was a person of lower level. They wanted to kill me here, Kibisu came here at 10:00am the date 27/08/1983 and the others who came here to kill me they came at around 1:00am because of standing firm and speaking about the issues of Kenya to make it stand in the right way. Even up to today you hear Raila has many enemies; who want to kill him. If you are a person who speaks the truth hear you are in trouble. These issues began the moment when Kenyatta was there, even the person called Kungu Karumba and Ronald Ngala died during the era of Kenyatta. This enmity is something that is here and when you are a truthful person people do not want you. That is the reason to why people did that. The issues have been done on Raila because the elections that were done were not realistic; it had ridging. Mulugulu is not wanted because he is speaking the truth. And Raila want these people to be united. But the mistakes are here in Kenya, Raila should get the leadership because the work that his father did was great and Raila has also done great work here. When someone does a great work here the way I was praying here they could have given me a great work like even being their advisor and do great things so that I know that I have left for them even when Mudavadi took over the seat of Otiende, they were supposed to give me a political position. Someone works here and leaves with nothing and then they want to kill him because he has said the truth. Raila is a man who has done great work here; a child of value. And he was to be on that position for five years and then he leaves the position. They have a grudge with him even before Raila left to America they wanted to kill him. When he has come back they are saying that he has come for that issue. And Raila is speaking like that to prevent Kenyans from dying; they sit together and find out the people who were killed and the ones that killed them why did they do that and where they are coming from. When opposition is there, does not destroy the nation it is giving your views. The person fearing the opposition is the one who is wrong. Raila is correct to speak with Uhuru Kenyatta they see where the mistakes are coming from and they ask Raila to stand on one side while they stand on the other side; they fear what. They have not spoken with Raila to know that he wants to tell them what. These people should seat together and not say that it is only Raila who has done this. When these people died Raila could have been killed through them also. How can he kill the people that will give him the votes of tomorrow? I am not putting that mistake on Raila. This is from the people here, even when Raila was there the issues of 2007/2008, the one who brought war here was who?  Robert Ouko who died here is it Raila who killed him? J.M Kariuki was it Raila who killed him? These people should see their mistakes and stop putting them on Raila. Their mistakes that they are doing here, of stealing votes, I wrote a letter to Raila in the year 2005 maybe he didn't take those issues fast as I had seen the things that were going to happen. I asked to seat with him together because bad things were going to happen before the elections in the year 2007. I have walked here I have gone to Kivuitu and I have told him the mistakes that are here, I was at the office of the governor speaking about the mistakes that are here, I have visited the officials at the court and informed them about the mistakes that are here. I wanted to sit with Raila and I tell him about the elections that we were going to have, problems were going to be there. They kept the hatred on me and Raila didn't call me we sit together I tell him about it. God is with me I am a prophet and I see the things that are going to happen. People here do not want a prophet like me. Even in the bible old prophets were killed; they were not needed. Even Jesus was followed because of prophesy and killed. I see many things and when I call the politicians that we have elected to come and I share issues with them they do not want. He sees that he has found a big position. Someone should not put Raila there; these people have their mistakes themselves. The things that are happening here they are the ones who are doing that. I have called my people of Vihiga tomorrow we are going to sit together and I have many points that I have prepared. We want to make here a big group that can bring peace here in Kenya. I am going to sit in that group and teach them things that I saw in America and Tanzania when I was there. Tanzanians had given me respect, I am the one who caused Oscar Kambona when he had disagreed with Nyerere, I organized for him to go to America and escape from Tanzania. The security that is here requires a person who knows more about traditional culture in order for him to speak about these things. Even when the people say about the chairman of heroes in Kenya, there are some who had bad motives and they feared to call me but we are with them in Kenya but we are together the way I stayed with people like Blandor who came to look for me like Ngoya, we could have had peace here. They could have called me to go and sit with them and tell them where the mistakes are. The issues that you are seeing about ridging have many mistakes, courts here have a lot of lies, and this disease has gotten into the police. They are not following the truth; they want to be given money. If he knew that you are going to reveal those issues about the bribe that he wanted he will shoot you; they will kill you because you will go and reveal about their issues. The leaders that we are having; the assistant chief, the chief and the county commissioners, they are few that are good but all the remaining have engaged into these issues and they want what they can use. In Kenya almost three quarters of the leaders are in corruption. Even these issues have gone to education, in church; even our pastors are going to pray for the person who has killed and they pray for good health upon him, and that person has made mistakes. There are things here corruption is affecting Kenya and that is the reason to why God is asking for that blood. And the person who has done that feels that he is good and he is asked to be prayed for and leave those things, his day is coming and he will die. They are using even when you see the issues of IEBC those people that are standing for elections and that is why you are hearing a lot of noise here. And I have also seen them myself. The person who has died the one called Mahasi was a magistrate in the court at Kakamega. When he was there and I had won the elections, he told me that they want to change the voting boxes and they wanted to give another person. The year 1973, there were elections here and I stood for the elections of people like Bahati Semo voted with Musa Mudavadi and others that were there. Those elections when I stood in charge it happened that Musa Mudavadi had not won, and it was Moi who had those issues. Moi was my friend but he was involved in theft; the person that he wanted he didn't want any other person to defeat him in those elections. When I went to see those elections I found that Bahati Semo was the one who had won and not Mudavadi. When it was known they were to kill me because their secret was revealed. They are things that I have seen myself again, my votes were given to another person. And that person used my salary for five years. There are things about something called trust and justice reconciliation, that organization was moving around and asking many questions, they called me and I went to say everything there and I gave the evidence. They said that we were going to be paid because of the loss that we got here where we were injured, up to today since the year 2009, we have not received anything they are just telling us the month of January, the month of December up to today we have not seen anything. A boy called Dr. Patrick Lumumba he was in position when we were presenting these things. You know Lumumba was a person who was truthful, they stopped him from that work, and he is not there. Here they do not want a truthful person. I was a truthful person and that is why they didn't want me here. I cannot go back to politics. There are many enemies here because I have stood here for the votes of parliamentary. They refused me, I stood for councilor position, they refused me; I cannot go back to it. People have not refused me; many people like me. Three quarters of people here love me; like the whole of western province. But the bad people do not want me. The politicians that are there today who have been elected cannot like me. I was the one who left that position for Musalia Mudavadi when he stood for it. And he told me lies the way he wanted me to stay with him there; and he didn't fulfill it I think it must be Moi who advised him not to do that or other advisors. Because Moi was my best friend and he knew my issues but he didn't want to see me again because he feared that I could be the president here, because many people here loved me. As I am here I was appointed as the chairman of Western Provincial Language and Oral Traditions Organization. That thing has broken today it is not there, I was appointed as peace committee chairman of Vihiga county, today that thing is not there, I was appointed as the chairman of the heroes in Kenya, that thing is not there. Ole Ntimama was my friend and when he heard that I was the chairman of heroes, that thing has stopped and it is not there. The government of Kenya the constitution that was passed was good. And the people accepted and they said that it was good. Why are they going back to that constitution changing it and destroying? Today I want here in Kenya if we can accept elder's council, if it can be formed and look the issues that are here and promote peace because the politicians that are going there are not going there in a right way. And that I why you are seeing that there are many petitions here. They are doing it and going to the court and these people do not pass well, today you are seeing the governors are in problems, they are followed and they are given votes, today they are followed and they want to be removed from the position. The senators are the ones in trouble, even the MPs are in problems, the person that is here is not in peace; there are few who are at peace. Like Dr. Bony Khalwale, a person that I really respect; today they do not want him because he says the truth, he does not show differences to others. Marende was here a very important person as a speaker today they have made him silent. For me the person that I respect is Lumumba; if he can be given a position here it can be very well. Khalwale should be given a position here, even if they can go to the Kikuyu to see if they can find. But the kikuyu are bad when they have found a person who wants to assist other tribes they do not want him; they want to kill him. The kikuyu do not want a real kikuyu to assist other bribes they want him to show favor to them alone. The word that Moi said when he got the position is that he said that he was following the footsteps. Moi should know that the footstep that he was following was of which type. There are people in a group that I thought I can go with them to see Moi I talk with Moi and ask him to repent the sin of saying that he was following the footsteps and many people have died here; even as I am alive I was on the list. Even Moi has my letters that I was telling him to reconcile, even Kibaki I told him when he was taking over the seat of presidency to organize we seat together and finish our issues, Moi to give him the position in a good way. Even when Kibaki got his work he didn't find it in a good way. Moi when he got the position he got it because of the favor from Kenyatta who wanted land in Rift Valley and he got in that trickery. Oginga Odinga fought in this nation and he assisted Mboya, was not needed. Mboya was killed. Ronald Ngala was an important person here, he was killed. If you are a person who is truthful, you do not go far, they follow you wanting to kill you; in most cases you will reveal their secrets. If Moi may like we sit together and I tell him the mistakes that he has done because if you have taken something in the wrong way it is bad, that thing does not go away it stays in the people that are coming after you.</p><p>
