Maduma gene gala kotetsanga ku ma kalunu kwanala vuchima vwe liboso vwa kulagila yivu na kotetsa mu tsinyasi tsie tsisere. Lunyasi lwene lula lwa kutsitsa kusia maduma gene gala, kusiela mu vindu viene vila ma kutsia kulagila ndio nangwa. Yilwo lwa ololanga vandu vala virenge viakusula kijira lunyasi lwe tsisere lwene lula. Kuhutsanga vindi vindu ku maduma ni tsingutsa kovola kutulitsa ku vuchafu; vindu vivuli kulia tsingutsa tsiene tsila. Ma lwa kutsa kugula tsinyanya na makabichi kwogitsa ku dave na lunyasi lwene lula loveye mu ma kutsia kodeka kulia; tsinyanya tsindala kulitsa tsimbisi ma kulia ni lunyasi lwene lula, lutsitsa koleta vulwaye vundi mivili jyitu jihula vulahi dave. Ma kandi kindi kindu kiveho musivitali tsia kutsitsamu tsinyasi tsinyinge tsitula engereka tsitsa yinu; kumanyi sia tsilombwa dave. nutsia mu sivitali kuli wambale. Nutsia kwenya mu lunyasi fulani vakovola tsia mu chemist. Lwa utsitsa mu chemist ogotwa vandu va chemist vanyola hayi na va isivitali vavula. Na nutsia mu lunyasi lwene lula tsisirinji tsierefu kivala bei. Na yive utsiyange mu siovitali kijira ni ya serekali; utsia onyola lunyasi vagulitsanga ku ibei iveye igulu sana. Na musivitali mwene mula, ni bahati kuhona. Kali vanyinge vavoyange referral iveye indahi, utsuitsa mu onyola vaveye mu na viga. vamanyi kindu dave. Kali nutsia tsa mwene mula ndi nangwa nu kutsila mwene mula. Vandi vahevwanga lunyasi vamilanga tsa vakutsa. Ku inze ndakatevi kandi vandu vitu va Kenya vano, visala koveye nangavio vinyinge via nyasaye ya kuha muno kwasimika tsinyasi tsiveye mu. Kohenze ku tsinyasi tsyitu tsia kinyeji yitsi, kwava kunyala konyola ku tsinyasi tsiakokonya kuvita isivitali. Haundi tsia vakohetsa musivitali tsiafwa madiku; kumbe yilwo lutsia kukumala ku madiku tsa makutsutsu. Nuutsa mu musivitali mwene mula, vandi vandu vivala vie engereka iyi vienya vandu vu munu vanyinge vakame. Kali ni vakovola ndi nangwa lunyasi lwu kohegitsa lwivulu, tsinyasi yitsio tsimala vandu muno. Si olola ni ohenza kalunu muno vandu vakali yivo vaveye nu vulwaye vunyinge vwe mivili jiavo sana. Kuvetsa ni vulwaye vula vwa kogotwa vutsa vonyolechi kutula kuliha. Kuhula si uhula dave, tsimobi tsisuyi, ligenda likutami; kali kwaveya kuli vandu vasatsa ndi mundu musatsa ove nu mukere wovo ukugutsana naye onyola yive mundu musatsa tsingulu tsiakufwa ku yive gukili na mukere wovo akili mushia. Mang'ana ge tsinyasi tsia kutsitsa ku tsikukubitsa kivi yitsi. Ku ndakayanzi vandu vitu muno vayanze vandu vitu va Kenya muno. Kogelitse kuli kunyala konyola tsinyasi tsyitu tsia kienyeji. Mundu kuli vagikuyu vavolwanga vajaluo ni vadamanu; inze nyala kukuvola ku vajaluo ni vadamanu. Mulala avetsa mu tsa mudamanu ma vavola vajaluo vosi. Kuli vavola vagikuyu muno vadamanu, inze mbola ku vagikuyu na vadamanu dave, mundu avetsa mu tsa mulala mudamanu ma yonyonyia ihiri yene yila. Kunyi kwenyanga vwamihi vonyoleka muno vavuli kuvika ku ihiri dave, vaviki ku mima jiu mundu. Mima ijio yijio jiakwenya kumanye jiveye ndi. vavola vatsie kuvika ku vandu vandi ni vudamanu. Gneyeka kivala kinu venya kotovola vimili vahenze vaveye ni kivune vanyala kwamiha muni samu, vandu vamanyi history yu mundu mwene uyu kutula mu livula lilie, yasoma ndi, yakola ku kindiki, yagenda ku navwaha. Kindu chene kila kilakokonya muno. Mang'ana muno ga olola ga kwakavola ge lihalika yaga, lihalika niva mundu wa kaloli wenya uhariki kweli vavititsi mang'ana muno vavola mukali wovo akuvugili ku nangwa uhaliki. Yee kalunu vakali veve va kalunu navoteva gene gala vakovola dave, kwenya kovole kalunu ha kangemi hala nutsitsa Nairobi, tsinyumba tsiveye wene yila tsia vakali vamala vasatsa; vita vasatsa. Ni umanye yatulana kuliha yita musatsa mwne ula, ma yavugula imali yali yu musatsa; ma iye ukwenya kandi; atakuua. Kalunu nuva tsa ni inzila yindi wenya kwekonyela mu wekonyele mu. Mang'ana ge lihalika ni itama iyi wachana na hiyo. Na unyala kuva na avana kali likomi anoho shirini na waharika kijira avana. Vatsitsa kwikala hala vavola baba uyu mima jijie milahi dave. Avana vakwita na avana vovo vene ma vavugula tusendi twene tula. Kuli ndakavola hano, mima jyitu muno kalunu kogelitse kuli kosoma mu bible samu, iveye mu na mang'ana manyinge ga hanyuma hala ga yivala na vandu vimba muno tsinyimbu tsindala tsindahi tsinyala kokonya muno vandu vamanye ku mang'ana gene gala; vamanye ni hayi ha kutula ni kogota inzila iyi. Na inyinga ya kalunu, inyinga ya kuduka ya himbe ya nyasaye yatsi yenya ahuli limoloma lilio ni likola lilio liveye ndi nangwa. Kalunu kuli ndakavola mang'ana ga makanisa, tsisirinji tsitsitsa mu makanisa vavola tsia nyasaye tsitsitsa kokola miyinzi jie likanisa, jikola ndio dave; vandu vala viluka natsio vatsia kokola minyinzi jiavo. kalunu vapastor vanyinge vakubanila ku vakali va vandu, vakola vindu viveye vidamanu, valwananga, yenyanga ha atsia kwilwatsa hala ave atulitsa tsisendi vulahi tsia na vanyole cha vatsia kutumukila. Na nutsia na pastor vwaha atsia kolomba mioyo jia vandu, yenya tsa hatsia kolomba imuya yeye ni inda yeye. Ku mang'ana gaveye munu madinyu sana ga kwenyanga Alulu lwa oveye ndi nangwa gelitsa kuli uva nogenda muno kuli ogenda muno ni wenyelitsa mang'ana gitu yaga, umanyilitse mang'ana manyinge nuhandika. Kitabu cha novole ulahandika mu, uhandike ni kivune vandu na vasome ku ni vagenye mwana uyu yanyola ndi mang'ana ge kivune yaga, na ivuli kuva tsa iyo ni inyinga yengine dave; mang'ana gandi gaveho ga mugamba. Kunyala kumala mang'ana gosi lidiku lilala dave. Ku lwa wakuhenza kandi mugamba gundi kandi gwa nakumanye kwamoloma ku mang'ana kandi. Ma utsie kohenza kandi mundu udukana okohe mang'ana malahi, utsie kohenza mundu mwene oyo alindi ndi inyumba yeye, amenyi vulahi ni mukali weve. Kijira nutsia ku mundu undi unyala konyola mundu utamenyi vulahi inyumba yeye akovola akohetsa mang'ana ga utamaduni na utamaduni vwamutama. Yatamwa kuva ni mukali weve, amanyi kindu chosi dave. Ku kindu chene kila okehenzelitse. Ma kandi koveye muno na vandu vitu va utamaduni, kalunu koveye ni shida munu ya utamaduni sana ya vasakulu. Vandu vatsia mwene mula vaveye tsa ni mima jinde jia lugano jitaveye milahi dave, vandu va culture vene yava vaveye tsa ni mima jinde lugano. Nutsia kuduka 26 Desemba, cha vatsitsa kulanga ni vanasiasa kutsa komolomela hene hala siasa. Lakini mima jiene jia utamaduni jiveyo dave. Ku kwakayanzi vindu veiene vila vakutuma ku mundu wosi komoloma nangaye ku mima jia kitamaduni otevelitse mundu mwene ula amenyi ndi nangwa. Ma kandi kuli nyenyanji ngovole vitabu viange viatsia vila kali nive nonyola ku tsisendi uguli ku vitabu viene vila; Michael yatsia navio. Kali vitabu vinde vikili muno genyekana osome ku. Kandi lidiku lilala olole ku visala viveye hano viasimikwa hano kijira ki. Jivene ni kivune. Ma kandi vindui via ndakoheye vila viveye mu tsikatasi vila, utsie kuvisoma mu utsie kumanya history yange iveye kindiki. Kijira gadukana nomoloma mang'ana gange ove numanyi vindu vila via DC yambabnndikilanga tsibarua, vindu via ndahandikanga vsitsia ku vandu vene vala, vindu viandanyola mu inyinga yali ya masujaa iyi. Vindu yivi nu visomi ku umanye wa moloma naye uyu ni mundu wa giligale. Ma kandi kuli vuyu yakakovola ya inonda hanyinge ha ndayinzilanga hanyinge kali India Bombay ndatsia ku yo kutsia kosomela yo, ndakasingila tsindege tsia air India. Ndakamaya India ndakalola mang'ana ga vahindi kandi vulahi samu, ndaveye mulala ku vandu va kivala chaganaganga nyala kuyinzila ku madiku matambi. Lakini kutsia kuduka kunyinga flani ovola apana, gaduka tsilane yengo nzie kulinda hango hange. Kuli kalunu ndi ndali na avana vayayi vali vavaga, vavili vakutsa yatigala mula. Ndali na vakana vavili; yavo vaveye mwoyo. Ma nu mukere wa mbeye nangaye uyu. Mukere uyu ndavika ku mukali undi dave, itama yange si yainomba ku kijira inze ngiri mundu mushia nzie koleta mukali undi nzivuli mu avana vandi dave. Na ndava ni itama yindi ngovole Alulu vakali vasungu vafwela ku inze; ndali na vakali vasungu valina vanyinge vanyanza. Kali ngano mbeye nu mukere uyu dave. Nimba na vakana vamereka venyanga vave vakali vange si ndahanda koye dav, vakali va Tanzania vanyenya ku vunyinge lakini si ndakola ku gene gala dave. Ma mu Kenya munu ndakava Embu yila na hayi na kandi kuli ndakakovola ndamenya ivuchaga kandi Arusha yila lakini ndavugula ku mukali undi dave. Ndaikutsila nu mukere wange uyu kuduka ku inyinga iyi. Ma inze unyala kunzavukanyia nu mukere wange dave, amanya kuli ndula hano kandi kuli isaa ya nzilana. Kandi kindu chosi chanyoye ku mbetsa mukere wange kulie nangaye kandi naye ndio. Ma kuva vutsa ndi nangwa nu mukere uyu ndi nangwa. Kuli ndakakovola mang'ana ga siasa gaindetela hano itabu inenene. Ndala hano ni tsing'ombe tsinyinge, ndali nfatuga vindu kivala bei. Tsing'ombe, tsimburi, tsingoko kindiki; kalunu mbula. Cha mbeye nacho ni miringa jie tsinzuki jieng'ine. Tsing'ombe tsiagulika kijira ndali ni ligovi lia AFC (Agricultural Finacial Corporation) ndegoba yo eloni. Lwa ndegoba ma lwa ndali ni tsingoko vandu vadamanu vakola vindu vidamanu tsingoko tsikutsa bei. Tsiali tsitigaye tsing'ombe tsinne tsila lwa vandu AFC vamanyi vitsa ni venya kugulitsa mulimi gwange ningulitsa na likili kufwa, bado 60,000. Mbeye ku nu mulimi gundi dave, gunu gwong'ene. Wa ngenda Mumias yila ni kutsia kuhila tsinyasi na kwigitsa mang'ana ga kitamaduni. Inze nzaha tsinyasi tsinyingesana, kali tsing'ombe yitsi nzahila, kali vwuki yivu. Niva ulagula kitabu kila, utsie kohenza kitabu cha valanga migitsu ga masumba. Mang'ana gwu vwuki vokola ku muvili gwu mundu. Masumba ni mima jia vandu venya mang'ana gandi gaveye mu lulogoli gavola utalia ku masumba gogo mba. Masumba ni kindu kuli kwa mfani ni onyola kuli mukana wovo nogona koye wakuia masumba gogo, nonyola mbotso wovo nogona koye wakulia ku masumba gogo. Ku vindu viene yivi ndahandika utsie kosoma vitabu yivi ku hu ganagana ha utavula kuhula vulahi dave, utsi uteve anoho uteve undi mundu. Masumba yago ohenzelitse nogona kong'ombe yokera mu mmbere nunwa, ulitsa ku masumba gogo. Lwa navite eng'ombe yeneyo nulia ku na wagona ku eng'ombe yene yila, wakulia ku masumba gene gala, eng'ombe eyo ilakumala. Nutsia nonyola engoko ulitsa mavuyu ga yo ogekoli mukali, wakulia ku masumba ga yo. Nutsia nonyola imburi ogone ku, wakulia ku masumba gene gala; umanye vindu viene vila vilakumala. Nutsia nonyola mulimi gwa waha mundu anoho ulame mulimi oleke vindu vidamanu ma vatsie kukuha ku maduma gatula ku maduma mwene mula na gatuli mwene mula, wakulia ku masumba gene gala; galakumala. Ni muyalanila ni mundu mmulimi ma utsie kulia ku vindu vitula mmulimi gwene gula, wakulia ku masumba gene gala. Niva ni mutende, muyalana naye ku mang'ana gu vutende ma lelo ahage yaha tsingutsa, ma umwahili tsingutsa na mukubana naye ku lwako, kandi yakulia ku masumba gene gala; galamumala kandi. Nuva nutsitsa mukanisa wilwatsanga ku mang'ana gu vuheyi, vwivwi na yive utsie kokola vindu viene vila, wakalia ku masumba gene gala, nyasaye akuvanza kandi. kindu cha valanga masumba yiki ni kindu kiveye lugano sana; kwa mfano niva mundu wamwatamana naye, mwakubitsana nangaye kivi, lelo yakavita tsikura kalunu akulanga mmba mwene mula atsie kukuha chukulia mutsie kulia naye emesa ndala, wakali ku masumba gene gala galakumala. Niva uvugula mukali wu mundu mugenda nangaye ma mundu mwene oyo musange naye chukilia ku sahani ndala, wakulia ku masumba gene gala. Nutsia konyola ku mundu mwene wa mugendanji ni mukali ula mundu mwene ukutsi na yive utsitsa kuginga mundu mwene uyu nuta mu kilindwa anoho utsitsa kuvita koye nu sigama koye, masumba gala gakumaliyi. ku masumba gaveye mu na mang'ana manyinge gadukana umanye gigitsa kindiki. Utatsia kunyola vindu yivi nugwilana tsa nzitsa ku yiki ni yiki kitakwekolekela ku dave. Mwana mukana natsiyi lukali, nakili kwivula yo dave na yive wakolekana wamukwa tsing'ombe vandu vene si vanyala kutsa kunwa ku maveere gene gala, mukali nakili kwivula si vanwetsa ku mavere hango hala dave, kuduka lwa yivula kwanza ku nanwe ku maveere. Na yive numanyi mwakulembana nu mukali wovo mwakulama nangaye, ukong'ondi ku matango yiku novola mang'ana gandi madamanu, nutsia kogona ku mukali mwene ula kandi yive ohona dave, kandi ulakutsa kandi; mukali ukumaliyi kandi. kandi mukali natsia yisuha musatsa weve naye avugila agone naye kali natsia nanyola niva yakukong'onda ku matango kunu naye kandi atsie konyola musatsa undi ichova yila kandi agone naye, kandi naye aveye ku madinyu. Mukali mweneyo musatsa niva nakutsi, mundu mwene wa atsitsa kuva nangaye wu kutanga ula kuduka amushiole kindu ku ave nangaye na ataha ku avana veve mmba dave, mukali mwneyo niva ni tsisendi tsia umuhiole tsila, kali tamutela mmukono dave. Niva mugoni naye mu lodgin mula uvuka tsa komesa tsa, mwene adole ku natsia kusiuva munzila, gave koye; ni yenyi kushila vandu veve, avashile. Niva mulembani anoho mukubani, mukali atakong'onda ku matango ndi dave; utarudi hapo tena. Na yive musatsa usije ukashika hii mwili yako ya kiume na kutingisha na kusema mimi na wewe hapana. Inyumba yinu kuli iveye ndi nangwa kutemane nu mukere wange anoho mbeye ni mukali undi ichova, ma mbuguli imbatsi ma ndeme mu kiliango ma simuki nzie, nyala kwilana mmba mula dave. Nisila mu ninzia mu luvetsa lwakufwa, ndakwimala lwakufwa. Ku genyekana nzilane mu kandi dave. Na wiluchi mmba mumwo nutsiyi kugona murumu ichova, yive wakwisunga inyumba yoyo. Haitsuru avadhali ogone murumu indala lakini bora tsa kindu mukubani mwilana tsa kandi muva hala, muvetsa tsa hala mugona tsa hala. Kisaye; kutatsitsana kisaye yicho kindu kidamanu. Lakini mang'ana gandi gi likubana yaga, mukubana tsa na mwilana mulia imesa ndala. Mukali wovo naveye ni mupango gwa kando gula ma umunyole naye, gene gala makosa manene sana, nitali oveye ni cha unyala kokola dave kijira si unyala kumusalitsa dave; mukali amanya yatsa mmba ma yisinga vulahi; kijira kali vakali vanyinge va vandu vagona ku ichova iyi ni vavetsa vagona ku na vandi. Vene yava vaveye ni chigalo dave; malaya. Oveye ni kindu cha unyala kwigala ku ovole, nitali valala vamanya vakubaga vakali vavo. Ku gene ghala si gaveye ga unyala kuvika ho kikwazo ndi utsie kwita mukali dave; oleka tsa ndio, olononyia tsa maisha gogo. Nava nagoni ichova, yive umanyi wagoni da kijira kali unyala kutsia kogona mmaliga, nu manye agoni hayi. vandu vamanya mang'ana gu mukali lwu musatsa avetsa nakutsi ku valola akuba tsikwiri natsia indangu yila, lakini yive ukutsi si unayal kumanya gene gala dave. Ku kalunu mala no kovola ndi nangwa migitsu ga vutamaduni mbeye nangago manyinge sana na ndahandika mu vitabu ku vunyinge. Kandi migitsu ga siasa mbeye nangago ku vunyinge sana kandi ndavika mu vitabu, vulimi mbeye nangango manyinge sana. Kali chasala nyasaye yavola Musa ngohetsa avana visiraheli yava ushile mu kivala cha Caanan, kiveye mu ni migera, miritu ni kilahi. Nyasaye yakuha kivala kilahi na kukitumiikila vulahi dave. Gadukana kwilane mu malova gene yaga vulahi samu, kohenze mu viukulia viveye vilahi samu kutumikili. kalunu vandu vaveye nu vugeli samu vahenza ku maduma gaveye mu milimi, maduma gakuging'ana. Maduma gaveye malahi samu, vurimu vomeli ku vunyinge, misala jigilung'ani; vulahi vuveye mu. Na kunyi vandu vene va nyasaye yalomba ni kunyi kwa kugilung'ana kwa kwoneka kabisa na vindu viakwataga vigasi viviti. Kundakayanzi vandi vitu mutsie mu makanisa musale nyasaye, nusala lisala lilio mukanisa, kandi usale mmba nyasaye akohe vugeli kumanye ha kutsitsa yaha kutsitsa hayi, avana vitu vakulindi vulahi na kunyi kulindi avana vitu vulahi na kulamenya koveye nu vugasu. Kandi noveye nu mukali wovo mmba, inyinga iduchi mu talembani ku dave, henzi mumale mang'ana ginyu gukili kale. Ni muveye na avana vakola mang'ana gene gala, utalama avana dave, kilamo kituli ho; muhenze kuli munyala kumala mang'ana gene gala muvuli kuva mu kilamo dave. Kijira likutsa litigaye kalunu lie isaa ndala onyola wakakutsa anoho ula yakakutsa. Lwa mundu mwene ula akutsa na yive wakokola naye madamanu, tsisendi tsitula tsindamanu tsia ivane na yive ikandi utsia ulia ku; na yive kandi ukalika. Sande.</p><p>

MAIZE</p><p>
This maize we add in and today we are used to the baked maize flour and we add in the preservative to prevent weevil attack. That preservative when we go to grind the maize we grind when it is in and we cook it with that preservative. That is the reason to why you see those people their feet are not walking because of that preservative. We are spraying other things on the maize and we say that we are removing the dirt; so that things do not feed on those vegetables. When we go to buy the tomatoes and the cabbages we do not wash instead we cook like that and that insecticide is there and we eat like that; we eat some tomatoes when they are raw and we eat with that preservative, it goes and bring other diseases and our bodies do not feel good. Another thing is there about the hospitals we are given medicine from abroad and we do not know where those medicines are made when you go to the hospital like Mbale. When you go for medicine they ask you to go to the chemist. When you go to the chemist you wonder where the people at the chemist are getting them and the people at the hospital do not have it. And when you ask for the medicine it is thousands of shillings. And you were going to the hospital because it belongs to the government; you go and find that the medicine is sold at a very expensive price. And at that hospital when you get healed it is luckily. Many people were asking where Referral hospital is and you go there and find that they are there and they are not aware of anything even when you go there. Some are given the medicine they take and they die. I would ask our people of Kenya to consider the trees that God has given us and we have planted them and they have much medicine. We should look for our traditional herbs, if we can get herbs that can assist us apart from the hospital medicine. Maybe the ones that we are given at the hospital have expired and maybe it is going to finish you in few days. When you go to that hospital people in abroad countries want many people from here to perish. Even they tell you about the family planning pills these pills are finishing people here. Today when you see it is the women that have many diseases in their bodies. We have disease that we wonder is coming from where. You do not hear, the eyes are not seeing, it is difficult to walk; you find a man has his wife that he stays with and the man is not performing his duties well and yet the wife is still new the issues of the medicine that we are using and they give us problems. I will like our people here to love the people of Kenya. We try and see how we can get our herbs. People like the Kikuyu are told that the Luo are bad but I cannot tell you that Luo are bad. There is only one person who is bad and then they say that all of them are bad. The way they are saying here that the kikuyu are bad I cannot say that the kikuyu are bad there is only one person who is band and then he spoils that tribe. We want the leadership that is given here not to base on the tribe but the characters of the person. We want to know the way the characters are they claim to put other people who are bad. When they want to elect people they should consider if they are of value and if they can lead, people should know the background of that person since he was born, his education and the type of people he has walked with. That thing will assist here. The issues of polygamy when one wants to have a second wife they have accepted that they say that your wife should first allow you to do that. Today if you ask the women about that they do not tell you, we want to talk about Kangemi there in Nairobi, there are houses there of the women who finished their husbands; they killed their husbands. You do not know what they did and she killed her husband, and then they take the wealth of the husband; and if she wants you will kill you. Today if you have another option of assisting yourself you assist yourself. The issues of polygamy you leave it you can have ten or twenty children because of polygamy. They go and sit somewhere and they say that the father doesn't have good behaviors. The children that kill you are your own and then they take that money. The way I have said here, our morals today we should try and see the way we can read the bible, it has many previous teachings that it is explaining and people are singing songs that can assist and people should know those things; they should know where they are coming from and losing the way. And the present times are close whereby when God comes he wants to hear about your saying and your actions. Today I have said about the issues of church money comes in and they say that it is going to do the work of God, it does not do like that those people run away with them and they go and use it for their own work. Today many pastors are fighting over the wives of other people, they are doing bad things, they are fighting, they want where they are going to preach money should come out of there well for them to go and use. And when you go with a pastor somewhere to bless the hearts of people he is going there to make things for his own stomach. There are many difficult issues here Alulu and we want you the way you are walking here as you gather our words, you get to know many things as you write. The book that you will say that you will write, you write when people will be reading it they will wonder where did this child get these words of value, and it should not be at this moment there are words for tomorrow. We cannot finish all the words in one day. You will organize for another day and we speak other words. And you should look for a person who can give you good words, you observe the person the way he has taken care of his family, if he is staying well with the wife. Because if you just go to another person who doesn't have a good family and he say that he is giving you the traditional cultural words and yet the culture has refused such a person. He has been defeated to stay with the wife, he does not know anything. You should look keenly on that thing. We also have our people of the culture; today we have a cultural problem with the old men. People have engaged in who have different behaviors that are not good, these people of the culture have different behaviors. When it is on 26th December, what they do is to call the politicians to speak there. But the cultural laws are not followed. We would like that if they send you for these things you come and we speak about the things of the traditional you ask how that person is staying. Again I wanted to tell you that if you get money you buy my books; Michael went with them. I still have those books here you should read them. Again one day you should see the trees that are planted here and why are they planted here. They have value. Again the things that I gave you the papers that are there you go and read my history and you see it has what because when you read my books you should know those things that DC wrote the letters to me, the things that I was writing as they went to those people, the things that I got during the season of the heroes. When you read those things you will know that you are speaking with the right person. And the way this one has said he has followed me to many places and I was working at India Bombay I went there to read, I have managed the flights of air India. I have stayed at India and I have done their things very well, I was among the people that the world thought I can work for many days. But up to a certain point you say no you are supposed to go back home and take care of your home. Like today I had my children that are three, two of them have died he has remained one. I had two girls who are still alive. And this wife that I have and I never married another wife, my greed has not made me to go and marry another wife and give birth with her. And if I had greed Alulu I am telling you white women came to me; I had many white women who were my friends and they loved me. I couldn't have married this wife because I had many American ladies who wanted to be my wives I didn't stick to them, Tanzanian women wanted me but I was not doing that. And in this Kenya I have been in Embu wherever and the way I have told you I was staying in Chaga and Arusha there but I didn't take another wife. I have persevered with my wife up to this moment. And you cannot separate me with my wife, she knows the way I leave here and the time that I come back. And everything that I get I give my wife and we eat together same to her. And we are just the way we are with my wife. The way I have told you the issues of politics have brought me a big problem. I had many cows and I had kept many things. Cows, goats, cows but today I do not have. What I have are the hives and the bees alone. The cows were sold because I had the debt for AFC (Agricultural Financial Corporation) I took there a loan. When I took the loan and I had hens and people did bad things and all the hens died. I had remained with four cows and the people of AFC they came and they wanted to sell my farm and I sold them and I have not finished the debt, I still have 60,000 to pay. I do not have another land, it is this one alone. I walk to Mumias and I take there herbs as I teach the things of the culture. I am giving many herbs; I treat even the cows, even this honey. If you will purchase this book you go and look for the teachings about "Masumba" The things that the honey does to the body of someone. Masumba are the behaviors that people want and there are things in maragoli that you should not eat your own masumba. It is like when you have found your daughter and you have slept with her it means you have eaten your own masumba, when you sleep with your sister you have eaten your masumba. These things I have written you go and read them and you think where you have not understood you come and ask me or someone else. When you sleep with the cow that gets milk from and you drink the milk then you have eaten your masumba. When thy slaughter that cow and you eat it and you had slept with it then you have eaten your own masumba, that cow will finish you. When you get a hen and you eat the eggs from the hen that you made to be your wife you have eaten your masumba. When you get a goat and you sleep with it you have eaten that masumba; you should know those things will finish you. When you go and curse a person's land and then you are given maize harvested from that land and you eat then you have eaten your masumba; they will finish you. When you are suing a person because of the land and then you eat the harvest from that land then you have eaten that masumba. If you are quarreling with your neighbor and then you pick vegetables and give her and you are battling over the fence she has eaten those masumba; they will also finish her. When you go to church and you are preaching about adultery, theft and you go and do those things, you have eaten those masumba, God will judge you too. The thing called masumba is so different; for example if you find someone that you have had issues with and you have troubled one another, today he has won elections and he has invited you to come to his house and you share food from one table, you have eaten that masumba and it will finish you. When you are hanging with another man's wife and you eat food together with that man you have eaten that masumba. When you are hanging with another man's wife and that man dies and then you are going to that funeral or you are touching the body or putting the body in the grave or moving around the dead and bowing to him then you that masumba has finished you. Masumba has lot of things that you should know they are teaching what. You should not just get into things and you say that you are doing this and that. When a wife has been married to you and she has not given birth and you have paid dowry when the parents cow they cannot drink milk, when a woman has not given birth they do not drink milk from that home, when she gives birth that is when she will take milk. And when you know you have quarreled with your wife and you have cursed, and she has spanked her laps and said bad words, when you go and sleep with that wife you won't survive, you will also die; the wife has finished you. And if the wife swears and spanks the laps and the she goes out and find another man and sleeps with him, she is also in trouble. That wife if the husband dies, the man that she will sleep with has to give her something and she should not share the thing that she has been given with her children, that woman if it is the money that you have given her, you should not put it in your hands. If you have slept with her you should put it on the table, she should pick it and go and throw it on the road, and it is upon her if she wants to take it to her people. If you have disagreed or you have fought, a woman should not spank her laps, you will not get there again. And a man you should never tough your penis and shake it then you say to her that she will never get there. For example the way I am in my house and I disagree with my wife or I have another wife outside, then I take an axe and then break my door and I leave I can never return to that house. When I get back through it I have finished myself and it is done. I am not supposed to go back again. And when you have escaped your house and you have gone to sleep in a room outside, you have killed your house. Its better you sleep in one room and if you have fought you just come together again, you are just together and you sleep together. Fighting and removing blood is the bad thing. But the other issues of fighting you just fight and you come together and share a meal. When your wife has a relationship with another man and you find her that's a big mistake, but there is nothing that you can do because you cannot harm her; the woman comes to the house and she bath well; because the wives of people are sleeping with another men outside there. They are not settled they are prostitutes. There is nothing that you can do; there are some that beat their wives. That cannot press you to go and kill your wife; you leave it like that because you will just destroy your life. When she sleeps out you do not know maybe she has slept in the funeral, where will you know she is from. The people who knows about the issues of the wife when the husband dies they see her screaming and moving to the back, but when you have died you cannot know that. Today I am saying these issues of traditional culture I have written them in many books. I also have the teachings of politics and I have kept them in books, the issues of farming I have many of them. God told Moses that he was giving him the children of Israel to take them to Canaan, it has rivers, forests and it is good. God has given us a good world and we should use it well. We should get back to the soil well, we should look for the food that is good and we use. Today people who are wise they look after the maize that is on the farm, if the maize is okay, if it has weed, have the trees changed, do we have good things there. We are the people that God made and we are the ones that have changed and gotten spoiled and the things that we planted they have passed. I will like our people to go the church and pray, you make your prayer in church, you pray in the house for God to give you wisdom to know where you are heading, our children to take good care of us and we take good care of them and we will live with blessing. When you have your wife when it is almost in the evening you should not quarrel finish your issue early. If you have children that are doing those things, you should not curse those children, there should no curse, you look the way you can finish those things you should not have curse. Because the death that has remained is one and you find that you have died or the other one has died. When that person dies and you have done bad things with him, dirty money is given and you go and you have a share too; and you also die. Thank you.</p><p>
