This is a bare skeleton of the text collection. There will be an
introduction, etc. A reader would select a text, but perhaps from a
list of authors rather than an unstructured list of files. The logic of
the collection is that each directory contains all and only the
materials for a text, and contains its own HTML.<br>

<br>

The texts that we have are as follows<br>

<br>

<a href="150/150_Maduuma.html">150 Herman Asava Maduuma</a><br>

<a href="153/153_Kugavula_Murimi.html">153 Herman Asava
Kugavura Murimi</a><br>

<a href="154/154_Kuhitsa.html">154 Herman Asava Kuhitsa</a><br>
