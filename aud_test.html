In the last recording, we encountered two pronunciations of certain verbs, for example <i>ndaakaguliza, ndaakakalaanga, ndaakadeeka</i>. Now I want to know what the best English translation would be for each version, and how each form is used. I have recordings of the two pronunciations below. Please listen to #1 and think about the meaning that goes with that pronunciation, then do the same for #2.
<p>
#1, Press play: 
<audio id="ak_complet.wav" src="ak_complet.wav"></audio><button onclick="playAudio('ak_complet.wav')" type="button">play</button> Form #1 is generally used to announce that some expected task is now complete, for example, the food is now cooked so you can come eat.
</p>

<p>
#2, Press play: 
<audio id="ak_explan.wav" src="ak_explan.wav"></audio><button onclick="playAudio('ak_explan.wav')" type="button">play</button> Form #2 is generally used to explain where a thing came from, or what happened to it, for example you could be explaining how the food got to the table.
