<p class="MsoNormal"><b>More about how to actually
find words<o:p></o:p></b></p>

When you go into the actual dictionary, you will notice a floating
bar of underlined letters at the top. If you click on one of those
letters, it
takes you directly to the first word whose stem starts with that
letter. Let&rsquo;s
say you want to look up the meaning of the word <i>isaaga</i>.
You have to know
that the stem for this word is <i>saaga</i>, so you click
the letter &ldquo;<u>s</u>&rdquo;
in the floating bar. If you click &ldquo;<u>i</u>&rdquo;,
you won&rsquo;t easily find what you
are looking for. Look for the first letter of the <b>stem</b>,
not the first
letter of the word. Go back to the explanation of how to figure out the
stem,
if you looked up &ldquo;<u>i</u>&rdquo;. When you
find the nouns, notice that is lookes
like i<b>saaga</b>. The stem is put in bold.</p>

Okay, now you want to look up the meaning of <i>iziseetwe</i>.
First, you know this is a plural &ndash; <i>izi</i> is
the plural prefix, the
singular is <i>e-</i>. You found <i>isaaga</i>
pretty quickly since it was
almost at the top of the collection of <i>s</i>-words. You
will just have to
scroll down from <i>ili<b>sa</b></i>&nbsp;to
find <i>e<b>seetwe</b></i>
(&ldquo;mousebird&rdquo;). This should not
be too hard since the stem is in bold and it&rsquo;s on the left,
so watch for <b>seetwe</b>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Test time!</i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">What are <i>amahiligoma</i>?
First, figure out the stem &ndash;
chop off the plural noun class prefix. Then look for the stem.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Is there a better way to search?
Maybe. You can also search
using the browser&rsquo;s search function. Often this means
pressing ctrl-f then
typing in the text that you are looking for. You can also use the
magnifying
lense icon to search on a phone browser (no ctrl key!). This is usually
a good
way to look up a Logoori word. You can search for any text on the page,
including
the English translation, but don&rsquo;t bother searching for the
verb &ldquo;play&rdquo; since this
will take you to each and every recording-playback button (there are
thousands).</p>
