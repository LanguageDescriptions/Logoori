<h2>About spelling versus pronunciation</h2>




<p class="MsoNormal">The first thing to understand is that the dictionary uses
both &ldquo;spelling&rdquo; and a phonetic writing system intended to inform the reader
about the difference in the vowels of the roots <i>umul<b>i</b>tu</i> &lsquo;forest&rsquo;
and <i>ikil<b>i</b>tu</i> &lsquo;chest&rsquo;. The first column in each entry is a modified
spelling which lists &lsquo;lumber&rsquo; and &lsquo;cane&rsquo; as ulu.<b>baaho</b> and i.<b>baakoola</b>,
where a period separates prefixes from the root and the root is in bold. When
you want to look up a word, look for the root in bold. After this there is a
phonetic annotation which indicates how the word is pronounced ([&#650;r&#650;b&aacute;&aacute;ho,
&#618;b&aacute;&aacute;koora]). Looking up a word is primarily based on spelling, therefore you do
not need to know whether the vowel spelled <i>i</i> (or perhaps <i>e</i>) is
phonetic [i] or [&#618;]. Therefore, first we consider how Logoori is spelled.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Words in Logoori have been spelled in many ways, starting
with the Litu &amp; Rees Bible translations. The usual practice is to spell things
the way they would be in Swahili, which works when the sounds of a Logoori word
are just those found in Swahili as well. But Logoori has more sounds than
Swahili does, in fact very few words of Logoori are composed of just the sounds
of Swahili. Swahili does not have tone or distinctive vowel length (there are
words like <i>choo</i> with a double vowel which have another explanation), but
Logoori does have both. The matter of vowel length is standardly solved in
Logoori spelling by doubling the letter of long vowels, however, not everybody
does this, so <i>ihiili</i> &lsquo;clan&rsquo; might also be spelled <i>ihili</i>. Because
there is a difference in noun class, a person would know that <i>ihili</i> is
&lsquo;clan&rsquo; and <i>ilihili</i> is &lsquo;puff adder&rsquo;. But there are plenty of cases where
real confusion can exist if one does not write long vowels differently from
short vowels. Even though people often leave out an indication of vowel length,
this work will always follow the practice of doubling vowels which are long.
However: because there is often uncertainty as to whether a certain vowel is
long or short, in sorting roots, long vowels are treated the same as short
vowels, so roots are presented in the order:<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">as though <i>aa</i> is spelled <i>a</i>.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">Another spelling matter is the fact that conventionally, the
second root consonant in <i>ihii<b>l</b>i</i> is spelled with <i>l</i>, but its
pronunciation is more like <i>r</i>, and some people write <i>l</i> vs. <i>r</i>
indiscriminately. In this work, even though that consonant is most generally
pronounced as <i>r</i>, following tradition it will be <b>spelled</b> as <i>l</i>.
In the parts of the dictionary with actual pronunciation, you will find <i>r</i>
and <i>l</i>, depending on the pronunciation of the individual.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">What spelling conventions are followed in this dictionary?
The basic principle is to use only ordinary letters a-z. That means that
certain consonant distinctions are not kept ([ny] versus [&#626;]), the vowels [&#618;,
&#650;] are not marked, and tone is left out. Spelling is lightly augmented with an
apostrophe. The apostrophe is used for two purposes: (1) the nasal [&#331;] as in <i>eng&rsquo;oongmbe</i>
&lsquo;cow&rsquo;, just as in Swahili, and (2) to indicate the typical omission of a vowel,
for example <i>um&rsquo;bano</i> &lsquo;knife&rsquo;, <i>l&rsquo;laande</i> &lsquo;decorative plant&rsquo; &ndash; this
is done inconsistently in writing Logoori. Omission of vowels is a
highly-variable feature of the language, but in two contexts there is
near-universal vowel omission. First, the vowels <i>i, u</i> are deleted in the
prefixes <i>mu, mi</i> when the following consonant is <i>v, m, p, b</i>,
therefore <i>umu-vugusu &rarr; um&rsquo;bugusu</i> &lsquo;Bukusu&rsquo;, <i>umu-fuundi &rarr; um&rsquo;fuundi</i>
&lsquo;craftsman&rsquo;, <i>umu-moosi &rarr; um&rsquo;moosi</i> &lsquo;left hand&rsquo;, <i>imi-piila &rarr; im&rsquo;piila</i>
&lsquo;balls&rsquo;. This reduction usually also causes <i>v</i> to change to <i>b</i>. The
second near-universal vowel deletion is that <i>u,i</i> in a prefix is deleted
between <i>l</i>&rsquo;s, for example <i>ililooto &rarr; il&rsquo;looto</i> &lsquo;dream&rsquo;, <i>ululimi</i>
&rarr; <i>ul&rsquo;limi</i> &lsquo;tongue&rsquo;. Apostrophe is used to indicate that a vowel has been
deleted. This deletion of vowels is discussed in more detail in the grammar.
What is important to know for the dictionary is that because these vowels are
almost always deleted, they are <b>not</b> included in the spelling. However,
another vowel deletion that occurs is that <i>u</i> in the prefix <i>mu</i> may
be deleted optionally, therefore <i>umugadi</i> &lsquo;bread&rsquo; is sometimes pronounced
<i>um&rsquo;gadi</i>. The difference between deletion in <i>um&rsquo;gadi</i> and <i>um&rsquo;bugusu</i>
is that there is deletion sometimes in &lsquo;bread&rsquo; but deletion happens almost
always in &lsquo;Bukusu&rsquo;.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There are many features of pronunciation which are not
represented in the present spelling (which is mainly a systematization of
most-common spelling practices). But the dictionary has <b>both</b> spelling
and a pronunciation key.</p>
