<h2>Structure of the dictionary</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>This
dictionary is an alphabetized list of words in spelling. As explained above, it
is alphabetized according to the root of the word. Following the word is a
phonetic form of the <span class=GramE>word,</span> and in a number of cases a
playable recording of the word – see more details about the recordings below.
This is followed by part of speech (n=noun, v=verb, adj=adjective), when the word
is a noun it gives the noun class number, then a translation into English, and
further explanation as appropriate.<u1:p>&nbsp;</u1:p>A noun is usually given in
the singular and the verb is given in the infinitive. At present, only nouns and
verbs are included.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>The
actual prounciation of words varies considerably in the <span class=GramE>language,</span>
therefore many entries are supplemented with playable recordings and a phonetic
transcriptions to familiarize you with these variations. The spelled noun <i>ichaage</i>
‘grain storage area’ is accompanied by a phonetic form, <i>ɪcháage</i> which
adds vowel quality and tone information based on the dominant pattern in my
data. This does not mean that everybody pronounces the word that <span
class=GramE>way,</span> it means that most examples in my data are pronounced that
way. In <i>ɪcháage</i> the phonetically-enhanced main entry is followed by transcription
of 4 specific pronunciations: <i>ɪcháágɪ, ɪcháage, cháagɪ, cháage</i>. A
play-button precedes each transcription and is enclosed in brackets with it. As
you can see from this, there can be differences in tone, the presence of the
initial vowel, and the choice of the final vowel. These are quasi-random
samples of recordings, intended to acquaint a listener with some of the pronunciations
of words. There may be multiple recordings from a single speaker either because
of a substantial difference in token pronunciations, or because there is <i>little</i>
difference, and a listener should get acquainted with ‘the same thing’ said at
different times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Transcriptions
are my judgments based on the work that I have done with these speakers. They
do not include every minute noticeable detail, and often involve difficult
threshold questions. In the recordings of <i>lugada</i> ‘smoking pipe’, it is
unclear whether the specific utterances [ʊrʊgáda] and [lʊ́gáda] differ in the
tone of the prefix /lʊ/. This is because the H tones before the stem come from
a tone assimilation rule which is variable, therefore many actual pronunciations
are possible which extend the tone from /gá/, so in [ʊrʊgáda] the H tone may be
‘somewhat’ extended to the left. In many examples, the syllable to the left of
the basic H toned syllable is half-way raised relative to the syllable before
that. The pitch range of a final syllable varied substantially, and sometimes a
speaker will end with a higher than usual pitch just because of recording
circumstances, leading to some higher-sounding word-final un-toned syllables.
The citation tone of words can be very difficult to determine, since words with
no H and words with one H at the beginning of the stem often sound nearly the
same, differing only in pitch range and perhaps rate of pitch fall. Through
contextual analysis, the difference becomes easy to hear, this is only a
problem with citation forms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>As
for the r / l difference, clean classification in terms of the International
Phonetic Alphabet is impossible. The reason for this is that “l” probably was originally
[ɭ] which is a mix of <i>r</i> and <i>l</i>, so anything in that general range
is accepted and actually produced. No note is made of the different pronunciations
of <i>y</i>, these samples expose you to the continuum of pronunciations, where
you may or may not notice the Swahili/English-like version versus the
flat-tongue version. In the two pronunciations of <i>ʊmʊgádi</i> ‘bread’, <i>g</i>
is pronounced differently, again another variable feature of pronunciation in
the language.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>Sometimes,
the recordings vary a bit in grammatical form, especially noun class, perhaps
because a speaker only uses the noun in the plural, or applies a different noun
class to the same word (for example people differ in whether to give the word
for “tradition” in the singular or plural: <i>ʊmw-iima</i> vs. <i>im-iima</i>;
‘law’ could either be given in the singular, <i>il-lago</i> or the plural <i>ama-lago</i>).
Borrowed words are especially variable, so if you pronounce the word for
‘loquat’ as <i>ipalapaandi</i>, you may not find the word listed under a root <i>palapaandi</i>,
since it is listed as <i>balabaande </i>which is the more common version (from <i>ilibalabaande</i>).<u1:p>&nbsp;</u1:p>Multiple
entries may be made for words having different pronunciations, such as <i>kwɪ́ɪ́tyamʊra,
kwɪ́ɪ́syaamʊla</i> or <i>kwáásyaamʊla</i>. Such variants are cross-referenced
so that the entry for <i>kʊfʊ́gʊma</i> refers you to <i>kʊhúguma</i> (via a
link) and vice versa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>It
may help to know what the most common patterns of variation are. Many Logoori
speakers are aware that words with <i>p, t, <span class=GramE>k</span></i> in
languages such as Tiriki or Nyore correspond to Logoori words with <i>b, d, g</i>
respectively, which is why Swahili <i>posta</i> ‘post office’ is widely
pronounced <i>ebóósta</i>. Some speakers pronounce the word as <i>epóósta</i>. The
direction of change seems to be one-way: <i>p, t, k, ch</i> from outside
Logoori become <i>b, d, g, j</i> but <i>b, d, g, j</i> in a word from outside
Logoori (<i>ɪdííni</i> ‘religion’, from Swahili ultimately Arabic) keeps that
consonant as is.<u1:p>&nbsp;</u1:p>Expect there to be variation in <i>b, d, g, <span
class=GramE>j</span></i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>The
main purpose of the recordings is to give the user, especially one who is not
highly experienced in the language, an idea how words are pronounced and what it
means if I write “ɪmbárabará” versus “ɪmbárabára”. Or, if one personally pronounces
“knife” as [ʊm’banʊ] and you doubt that anyone would say [m’bano]<span
class=GramE>,</span> you can listen to a recording of both pronunciations.
There is no implication about what pronunciations are “correct, standard,
typical”, nor even necessarily “typical for that person”.<u1:p> The main
pronunciation entry says what is, in my experience, the most common
pronunciation, included recordings will tell you of other pronunciations and you
can hear the differences <i>ɪcháágɪ, ɪcháage, cháagɪ, cháage</i>, then finally the
entry may end with a pronunciation note, as in the entry for <i>cow</i> which ends
with the information <span style='font-size:9.0pt'>{sometimes ɪng'oombe}</span>.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto'>In
spelling, I write <i>l</i> and not <i>r</i>, but usually I phonetically
transcribe the sound as [r] when the individual uses phonetic [r] (Swahili-style
<i>r</i>, technically, [ɾ] in the IPA), otherwise [l]. Transcribed [l] may be technically
pronounced phonetic [ɭ], which is a mix of <i>r</i> and <i>l</i>. See the
grammar for more discussion of pronunciation of <i>r, l, ɭ</i>. Many speakers have
a pronunciation that varies along a continuum of [ɾ] to [ɭ]. This is only relevant
to understanding spelling – always spelled <i>l</i>, transcribed as [r] or [l] depending
on speaker. The dictionary does not generally engage in phonetic nuances.</p>
