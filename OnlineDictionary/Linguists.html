<h2>Note to linguists</h2>





<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">The
point of this note is to explain to linguists the nature of divergences between
the data given here vs. elsewhere, also to aid in understanding what claims are
being made. To recapitulate the explanation given above, the headword entry is
a &ldquo;revised orthographic&rdquo; form, which uses no phonetic symbols, adheres to Swahili-inspired
East African spelling conventions, and which is mostly consistent with observed
Logoori writing practice to the extent that vowel length is recorded, but
skipping over writing inconsistencies when it comes to writing [i u] vs [ɪ ʊ]. Actual
data are presented in phonetic transcription, using a &lsquo;generalized&rsquo; individual-phonemic
writing system. Elsewhere (for instance in the grammar) I give narrower
transcriptions that reflect properties of individual tokens, which means that the
example was said in that form by some individual. Because of optionality, a single
word (from the E-language perspective) can have a lot of concrete realizations,
even shying away from attempts to transcribe low-level physical differences.
The most frequent instantiation of such added possibilities in realization
involve tone, especially the question of when the phonological rule of Leftward
Spreading applies. In the grammar, transcriptions of tokens reflect the facts
of a particular token. In the dictionary, transcriptions abstract away from
that level of detail. Tones are transcribed without reflecting the effect of
Leftward Spreading, therefore the noun whose headword is <i>ulwaasaya</i> and
which has the posited pronunciation [ʊrw&aacute;&aacute;say&aacute;</span>] is actually usually
pronounced [ʊrw&aacute;&aacute;<sup>!</sup>s&aacute;y&aacute;] (but as noted in the entry can have a
phonologically distinct variant [ʊrw&aacute;&aacute;<sup>!</sup>s&aacute;ya]). The primary point of
mentioning at all that there is variation in pronunciation is to disabuse
non-linguist readers who might have such beliefs of the mistaken idea that
there is only one correct and proper form of any word in the language. The
secondary point is to expose linguists to some of the reality of the Logoori
language, which they probably have not themselves had previously. I believe
that presenting a more narrow transcription makes it harder for all parties to
discern the similarity in the attested variants, thus all forms of <i>ulwaasaya</i>
have two H&rsquo;s, but there can be variation in whether the second H is assigned to
the final vs. not (the grammar explains the nature of the nominal tone system,
whereby that is all that one has to say).</p>
