<span style="font-weight: bold;">Test versions of a Logoori wordlist</span><br>

<br>

Here  (links at the bottom) are some versions of a Logoori wordlist that I am&nbsp;developing for
scientific usage. That list is&nbsp;designed to be a
technical reference work. My present&nbsp;concern is with finding a
good way to also present the data in a fashion suitable
for&nbsp;a non-linguistic audience, especially Logoori speakers. I
would like to test different presentations, and solicit information on
advantages and disadvantages of these presentations. Please
send comments to Logoori.Project&#9786;gmail.com (replace &#9786; with @): tell me
what works and what does not work, especially why it did not work for
you.<br>

<br>

The&nbsp;files basically the same. Each is a single web page with a
recorded Logoori word, word transcribed, grammatical information, a
simplified&nbsp;stem, and an English translation. For a brief overview
of special symbols used in the transcriptions, see <a href="https://languagedescriptions.github.io/Logoori/WritingtheLogoorilanguage/">this article</a>.&nbsp;If
you are reading that page on a phone, there may be problems with the
print size of some sections, which I don't understand and I hope to fix
it some day. Very briefly, the transcriptions distinguish the Logoori
vowels [i,u] and [&#618;,&#650;] where [&#618;,&#650;] are either written as [i,u] or [e,o]
is normal spelling. Tones are marked, also there is a complex problem
regarding <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">ny</span>: the letter [&#626;] is usually&nbsp;spelled <span style="font-style: italic;">ny</span>, however, <span style="font-style: italic;">ny</span>
= [&#626;] and [n] are not pronounced differently by all speakers. Finally,
tones, which are systematically left out of writing, are included in
transcriptions. The transcriptions may be a bit difficult to interpret,
but playing the associated recording whould make it clear what the qord
in question is.<br>

<br>

Here is a simple explanation of a problem that must be addressed
in&nbsp;a&nbsp;wordlist, especially in a Bantu language. The word <span style="font-style: italic;">kod&eacute;eka</span>
'to cook' has&nbsp;the infinitive prefix&nbsp;/k&#650;/, which is
pronounced [ko] because of a vowel harmony rule in the language. The
root meaning 'cook' is -<span style="font-style: italic;">d&eacute;ek</span>-, and the suffix /-a/ indicates a particular type of verb form. The verb&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">kw&aacute;&aacute;ta</span> 'to do surgery' has the same infinitive prefix, pronounced [kw] because of a different rule of the grammar: the root is -<span style="font-style: italic;">&aacute;t</span>-. The word <span style="font-style: italic;">&eacute;!ng&oacute;k&oacute;</span> 'chicken' is made up of a prefix indicating noun class (class 9) which is /en-/, and the root which means 'chicken' is -<span style="font-style: italic;">goko</span>. The plural of this is&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">&#618;z&iacute;!ng&oacute;k&oacute;</span>, using a different class prefix (class 10) /&#618;zi-/. The noun&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">ekeg&oacute;&oacute;ngo</span>
'building pole' has a different prefix (class 7) /&#618;k&#618;-/ which is
pronounced [eke-] in this word because the vowel harmony rule is
triggered by the vowel in the stem -<span style="font-style: italic;">g<span style="font-weight: bold;">&oacute;&oacute;</span>ngo</span>. The plural of that (cl. 8) is&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">&#618;vig&oacute;&oacute;ngo</span> (no harmony, /i/ does not change, only /&#618;, &#650;/ change). The noun&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">&#618;ch&aacute;age</span> 'grain store' has the same cl. 7 prefix /&#618;k&#618;-/ but before the vowel of the stem -<span style="font-style: italic;">&aacute;ge</span>, the pronunciation of /k&#618;/ changes to [ch].<br>

<br>

Should the words be sorted alphabetically, according to the basic form as given in the list? <br>

<br>

&eacute;!ng&oacute;k&oacute;<br>

ekeg&oacute;&oacute;ngo<br>

ich&aacute;age<br>

kod&eacute;eka<br>

kw&aacute;&aacute;ta<br>

<br>

But not everybody pronounces the initial vowel of nouns &ndash; many people say <span style="font-style: italic;">ch&aacute;age</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">keg&oacute;&oacute;ngo</span>. If your pronunciation of the word is <span style="font-style: italic;">ch&aacute;age</span>, you would expect <span style="font-style: italic;">ch&aacute;age</span> to come before&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">&eacute;!ng&oacute;k&oacute;</span>. The solution may be for you to mentally put that vowel back, so remember to look for <span style="font-style: italic;">ich&aacute;age</span> and not just <span style="font-style: italic;">ch&aacute;age</span>. This imposes a burden on you the user.<br>

<br>

A possible solution is to sort words according to their stems, leaving
off the infinitive or noun-class prefixes. In that case, whether or not
you pronounce that initial vowel, you can find the word if you know the
stem:<br>

<br>

&#618;ch-&aacute;age<br>

kw-&aacute;&aacute;ta<br>

ko-d&eacute;eka<br>

&eacute;!n-g&oacute;k&oacute;<br>

eke-h&oacute;&oacute;ngo<br>

<br>

This also puts a big burden on the user, that of figuring out that the stem for 'grain store' is -<span style="font-style: italic;">&aacute;ge</span>.
So for any lexicon which is organized according to an abstract analysis
of words to be practical, it must also contain a basic grammatical
description that teaches users how to identify the stem. And I do not
know if that is practical. However, it will ultimately be necessary,
because some words <span style="font-style: italic;">do not have</span> a single basic form (infinitive, or singular). An adjective like -<span style="font-style: italic;">n&eacute;ne</span> 'big' always have some noun class prefix, so what form should be given as the entry for this word? <span style="font-style: italic;">mun&eacute;ne,</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> van&eacute;ne,</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> min&eacute;ne, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">rin&eacute;ne,</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> ken&eacute;ne, vi</span><span style="font-style: italic;">n&eacute;ne...</span>?&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Likewise, -<span style="font-style: italic;">t&aacute;&aacute;n&oacute;</span> 'five'. <br>

The test versions are as follows:<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="TestWordlist_1.html">Version 1</a> (simple alphabetical order)<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="TestWordlist_2.html">Version 2</a> (stems separated by a hyphen: is the hyphen a distraction)<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="TestWordlist_3.html">Version 3</a> (also sorted by stem: can you figure out where the stem is)<br>
