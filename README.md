# The Logoori Project

This is the main page for Dave Odden's project on Logoori. I have been working on a description of Logoori, one of the Luhya languages of Kenya. This is part of a wider project on Luhya languages, in collaboration with *__[Michael Marlo](https://sites.google.com/site/michaelrmarlo/), [Michael Diercks](http://pages.pomona.edu/~mjd14747/index.html), [Chris Green](http://thecollege.syr.edu/people/faculty/pages/lang/green-christopher.html), [Kris Ebarb](https://sites.google.com/site/kjebarb/)__* and others. My own web page is _**[here](https://sites.google.com/view/oddenlinguistics/home)**_. As the project progresses, I will make my findings available to the public. Because browsers are very inconsistent in how they present links (underlined? blue?), I put links in  bold italics so that you have a chance of guessing that there is something there to click.

__*[This paper](https://logoori.github.io/LogWrit2.html)*__ is especially intended for speakers of Logoori who might learn about the project. When we write about Logoori, we have to use a special system for writing that reports how words are pronounced. Speakers of Logoori implicitly know some very complex rules regarding vowel quality, length, tone and many other things, but generally do not know that their language uses tone and other such features. On that page, I present the main aspects of our writing system, along with sample recordings that you can listen to in order to better understand what we mean by "tone", "vowel length" and so on.
