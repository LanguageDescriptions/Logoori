# The Logoori Project

This is the main page for Dave Odden's project on Logoori. I have been working on a description of Logoori, one of the Luhya languages of Kenya. This is part of a wider project on Luhya languages, in collaboration with [Michael Marlo](https://sites.google.com/site/michaelrmarlo/), [Michael Diercks](http://pages.pomona.edu/~mjd14747/index.html), [Chris Green](http://thecollege.syr.edu/people/faculty/pages/lang/green-christopher.html), [Kris Ebarb](https://sites.google.com/site/kjebarb/) and others.
