<h1>The Logoori Project</h1>
<p>&nbsp;

<p>This is the main page for David Odden's project on Logoori. I have been
working on a description of Logoori, one of the Luhya languages of
Western Kenya. This is part of a wider project on Luhya languages currently under way in
collaboration with&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/michaelrmarlo/">Michael
Marlo</a> and <a href="http://pages.pomona.edu/%7Emjd14747/index.html">Michael
Diercks</a>. This work has been financially supported in part by NSF grant BCS-1355750 to Michael Marlo
at U. Missouri. My own web page is <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/oddenlinguistics/home">here</a>.</p>
<p>
The main components of this project are grammatical description, texts, and lexicon. My academic publications on Logoori are available <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/oddenlinguistics/home">on my web page</a>.
In order to understand the spelling system used in data presented here, non-linguists may want read this paper, <a href="WritingtheLogoorilanguage">'Writing the Logoori language'</a>. In writing about Logoori, I need to suppliment nd modify typical spelling in order to say things about how words are pronounced. Speakers of Logoori
implicitly know some very complex rules regarding vowel quality,
length, tone and many other things, but generally do not know that
their language uses tone and other such features. In the "writing" paper, I
present the main aspects of the writing system that will be used in this work, along
with sample recordings so that you can listen to in order to better
understand what I mean by "tone", "vowel length" and so on.</p>

<h3><a href="Grammar">Grammar materials</a></h3>
<p>This contains the (current draft of) the Logori grammar, which aims to explain the rule system of Logoori. This is a description of principles of word-formation and pronunciation, and is not a theoretical analysis as you would find in my academic publications. Also included are some basical grammatical tables, such as the verbal tone-paradigms which show how tone differences play an important role in grammar â€“ the tables includes recordings, so that you can relate the phonetic spellings to pronunciation.</p>
<h3><a href="LogooriTexts">Texts</a> <span style="font-size:83%;font-weight:normal">(stories and songs from North Maragoli).</span></h3>
<p>This is a collection of texts and songs, in the form of recordings, conventional Logoori spellings, and corresponding English versions, gathered from a number of speakers from northern evoRogoori</p>

<h3><a href="OnlineDictionary">Online dictionary</a></h3>
<p>This is a basic dictionary of Logoori words, including numerous recordings of pronunciations.</p>
