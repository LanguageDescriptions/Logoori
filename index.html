<h1>The Logoori Project</h1>
<p>&nbsp;

<p>This is the main page for David Odden's project on Logoori. I have been
working on a description of Logoori, one of the Luhya languages of
Kenya. This is part of a wider project on Luhya languages, in
collaboration with&nbsp;<a style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" href="https://sites.google.com/site/michaelrmarlo/">Michael

and others. This work has been financially supported in part by an NSF grant BCS-1355750 to Michael Marlo
at U. Missouri. My own web page is <a style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" href="https://sites.google.com/view/oddenlinguistics/home">here</a>.</p>

The three main components to this page are grammatical description, texts, and lexicon (my academic publications on Logoori are available <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/oddenlinguistics/home">on my web page</a>. Go to the appropriate sections below to find those materials. In order to understand the spelling system used in data presented here, non-linguists may want read this paper, <a href="WritingtheLogoorilanguage">'Writing the Logoori language'</a>. In writing about Logoori, I have to use a special system
for writing that reports how words are pronounced. Speakers of Logoori
implicitly know some very complex rules regarding vowel quality,
length, tone and many other things, but generally do not know that
their language uses tone and other such features. In this paper, I
present the main aspects of the writing system used in  this work, along
with sample recordings so that you can listen to in order to better
understand what I mean by "tone", "vowel length" and so on.</p>
