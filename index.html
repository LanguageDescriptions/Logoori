This is the main page for David Odden's project on Logoori. I have been
working on a description of Logoori, one of the Luhya languages of
Kenya. This is part of a wider project on Luhya languages, in
collaboration with&nbsp;<a style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" href="https://sites.google.com/site/michaelrmarlo/">Michael
Marlo</a><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">,&nbsp;</span><a style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" href="http://pages.pomona.edu/%7Emjd14747/index.html">Michael
Diercks</a><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">,&nbsp;</span><a style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" href="http://thecollege.syr.edu/people/faculty/pages/lang/green-christopher.html">Chris
Green</a><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">,&nbsp;</span><a style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" href="https://sites.google.com/site/kjebarb/">Kris Ebarb</a>
and others. My work has been supported by an NSF grant to Michael Marlo
at U. Missouri. My own web page is&nbsp;<a style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" href="https://sites.google.com/view/oddenlinguistics/home">here</a>.
As the project progresses, I will make my findings available to the
public. Because browsers are very inconsistent in how they present
links (underlined? blue?), I will try to put links in&nbsp; bold
italics so that you have a chance of guessing that there is something
there to click.<br>

<a href="WritingtheLogoorilanguage">This
paper</a>
is especially intended for speakers of Logoori who might learn about
the project. When I write about Logoori, I have to use a special system
for writing that reports how words are pronounced. Speakers of Logoori
implicitly know some very complex rules regarding vowel quality,
length, tone and many other things, but generally do not know that
their language uses tone and other such features. On that page, I
present the main aspects of the writing system for this work, along
with sample recordings that you can listen to in order to better
understand what I mean by "tone", "vowel length" and so on.<br>

Most materials can (eventually) be accessed via this page. Chapters of
the grammatical description of Logoori can be found here. At present,
you can get the following files:<br>
