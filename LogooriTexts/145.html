Lwa muyayi uyu yahama natsia kugula mulimi handi, yamanya kandi naduka yo nasula vatende kandi. Yamanya namenya tsa hango yaho yengine kandi yifenzela ho tsa. Na nyasaye yamanya navaha mwana mulala muyayi. Mwana oyo nakikili mudi nakikili kushila nasukulu muyayi oyo nayinzila, vulwaye vwamanya vutsa muyayi oyo nalwala. Lwa yalwala yamanya nakutsa naleka mukali oyo nu mwana weve. Lwa yaleka mukali weve uyu ni mwana weve na vahama kali vavola ku vatula hayi, vivuli vavo vaveye hayi mba; vali tsa veng'ine.

Na mutende mula yali ho si yali yanyola ku mwana dave, yamanya navugula mwana oyo vamuvolela ku ugulitsi mulimi yigu ulindili mwana oyo. Mutende oyo nagaya nyala kugulitsa mulimi dave nzihani kijira nyasaye yambaku mwana dave ndalinda mwana uyu musominye mwene alakatse komenya hango havo.

Natsia nalinda mwana oyo nasominya, namushila mu nasari nasoma, natsia paga class 8 nakola ligela navita vulahi namuhila mu secondary kandi navita ligela ma namwenyela igasi natanga liyinzila. Mwana oyo yayinzila, yamanya nayinzila ma vamuvolela utsie mmulimi mwinyu utsie komenya mu. yatsia mmulimi gwavo naleta kandi mukali. Vamanya vamenya mmulimi gwavo yigwo na mwana muyayi oyo nayinzila nyasaye navabarikia vanyola kandi mwana. Muyayi oyo yatuga tsing'ombe, nalekela mukere weve nameda mulimi guva munene namuvolela alimi atage maduma, maganda, masuguma nagulitsa. Mukere weve yamanya nakola ndio. Lwa yakola ndio, mwana muyayi uyu yayinzila Nairobi yamanya na retire niyilana hango. natsitsagilila tsa ni lilima lilie, natuga tsing'ombe, visungura; kali magondi ma natsitsagilila tsa kutuga, yataga maganda, maduma ni tsinjugu natuga ni visungura. Ku mwana muyayi uyu yamenya namenya lidiku lilala lwa yataga maduma gakola vulahi mba, navola afadhali ndage tsinjugu tsinyala kokola vulahi. Yataga mulimi gwosi tsinjugu na tsikola vulahi sanana yali yatuga kisungura chene yicho yali ni yachamina mmaisha gege sana. Ha yenya kutsia nicho cha yatuma tsa; tsia ondole vindu viange kuli vitsitsagila, na kisngura kitsia. Lwa kisungura chaduka mmulimi, kiyava tsinjugu yitsio kilia. Mundu oyo atsie mulimi atevane, kisungura, ni vwaha uyavi tsinjugu tsiange nalia? Kigaya inze manyi mba. Musakulu oyo yamanya nahenzelitsa navola mukere kunyala kokola ndi konyole kindu kilitsa viukulia vyitu viakwataga. Yatevelitsa vandu vamuvolela kulakuha vogeli vwa kugumila kindu kilitsa viukulia vivio. Vamuvolela utsie kolomba kindu mmulimi kifwane mundu, navika ku vulimbu ma nahanditsa ku musala. Lwa yahanditsa ku musala, ma oyo nava tsa yengo. Kisungura cha yatuma yicho nakevola utsie mmulimi utsie kolola kindiki kilitsanga tsinjugu tsiange. Lwa chatsia ni kitanga liyava tsinjugu na lwa chahenzaq tsimoni igulu ni kihenza kenyola kindu kisingiyi mmulimi kuli mundu. Kihenza keteva, "musakulu yive, nive umanya ulitsa tsinjugu tsyitu munu?" Kindu yicho chamujiba dave. Navola ma ngukubi. Kindu yicho chahera ku dave na kisungura chali kiyavi tsinjugu kiginji. Chamanya kitsia kevola ndakukuba; wiyame niva nive ulitsa tsinjugu tsyitu. Kindu yicho chahera ku dave. Kisungura chamnya kitsia kiduya mu kindu yicho ndio ingundi; mukono guhanda. Kilasa luvasi, kerenge ni kihanda mu. Kikuya mukono gundi, guhanda mu, kikuya mutwi kandi guhanda mu. Lwa musakulu oyo yatsa nahenza navola kutula lwa ngutumi yinu kumbe nive umanya ulitsa tsinjugu tsiange. Tsinjugu tsia ugunji yitsi vwaha okoheye. Navola "nyoye kindiki kiyavi." Nateva kisungura "yiki ni kindu kinyala kuyava tsinjugu? Nive uyavi tsinjugu tsiange." Mundu oyo yamanya navugula kisungura yicho, na yali yayanza kogenda nu mwana weve. Navola mwana weve nyenya utsie yengo ni kisungura yiki utsie kovola mama wovo asinzi kisungura yiki kulatsa kulila kumugorova. Mwana oyo yatsia navoha kisungura yicho ma natula nacho. Lwa yali nagenda kunzila nanyola vandi vakuba mprira,navugula kisungura navoha kumusara yaho natanga likuba mpira. Lwayahenza nalola isaa itsitsa ni yatsa navohola kisungura. Kisungura kimuteva, "muyayi yive, baba wovo akutumi ndi? Umanyi kuli baba wovo akutumi"  Muyayi oyo navola "yee." Kisungura kimuvolela vola koye kuli vakutumi. Muyayi oyo naganganyia ligali ngani yakwivla. Navola "ndakwivila ngotwa avoye ndi." Navola baba wovo avoye kutsie yengo mutsie kuvugula tsa idaywa enene mu tsinde usinzi aveye na vageni vatsa kulila; kwanza wakuchereva. Mwana oyo yamanya nanyagula yengo naduka ni kisungura yicho. Kisungura kimuvolela umbohole ngokonye kijira baba wovo aveye shimbe kuduka. Yamanya navohola kisungura yicho. Mwana navola mama, baba avoye uvuguli tsa idaywa enene mu tsinde usinzi vageni vatsa. Mukere oyo yamanya navola kisungura yicho sasa mulonde ku ni muyayi uyu mugimili idaywa vwangu vwangu kijira nale musakulu yatsanga  kijira alindanga kindu kilitsa tsinjugu tsitsie. Vamanya valonda ku idaywa vasinza vwangu vadeka, kisungura kevola muyayi kandi wakwivila. Avoye mwale tsa kidali tsa vulahi hu mugeni weve amanya agone, ni vala. Vadeka vwangu, valuga vuchima; vakala ku vwavo vavugula vundi vavika musakulu oyo nu mugeni utsa oyo ma vavikila musakulu oyo nu mugeni weve. Ma valagila lwe kisungura chalola isaa ya musakulu amanya yatsanga, chamanya kitsia kegona havogono hala, chinyila ho kivaka ku vuchafu. Musakulu oyo lwa yingila navola "ndola ki, mwana yivi ngutumi ndi?" Mbo inze undumi vavuguli idaywa enene mu tsinde utsa nu mugeni." Na oyo ngovole usinzi kisungura yiki. Kisungura yicho chamanya chiluka ni kereka musakulu oyo nalembana ni kitsia. Lugano lwange lufwere yaho.</p>

<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">A cat</p>
<p>My name is Hellen Makungu today is on 6/5/2014 I have a story about a man and a woman and the way they got a child and refused the child. There were a wife and the husband who stayed for many years without giving birth to a child. God gave them a baby boy and they educated him from nursery school to secondary school. Their son got work and he went to Nairobi to work. He did his work and he married a wife. He built for the wife a house in a home and she stayed there. When he married he disagreed with the parents and he stayed with his wife alone, they built their house and they fenced it, they neglected their neighbors, parents; they were staying alone. When the husband came from Nairobi he used to buy things and he gives to wife and he warns her that he should not find her at the neighborhood or with his parents. The wife perserired and stayed at her home. When the husband retired he came home, the parents refused to stay with him and they told him that he would move to another place. He moved to another place and he got land there and he built there a house, he got there and found neighbors whom he neglected and stayed alone. God blessed them with a son, and they were now in their elderly age, God added them another one boy. The boy was working in Nairobi and also at home. When this boy moved and bought land somewhere else, he reached there and neglected neighbors. He stayed at that home alone and he fenced it. And God gave them one boy. When that boy was still young before taking him to school he was working, he fell sick. When he died he left the wife with the baby boy. When he left the wife with the boy they moved to another place without considering where they were coming from, where their parents were, they were just alone. People were just wondering. That person died and they buried him. When they burred him the wife remained with the baby boy. The wife stayed for a few days and she died. When she died they buried her. When people came there they ased themselves "we have buried all the people from this home and they have left a child who is not telling us where they are, how will we know where they are and how is this child going to live." There was a neighbor who was there and had not had a child, she took that child and they told her to sell that land and take care of that child. The neighbor refused to sell the land and she said that she will sacrifice because God had not given her a child she will take care of the child and take him to school and the boy will come back and live at the home where he was born. That neighbor took that child and went with him, they left that home she went and took care of that child and she educated him, she took him to nursery school, he went up to class eight and he did the examination well and she took him to a secondary shool he passed his examination and she looked for him work. That child did the work, he worked and then she asked him to go and live in their land. He went back to their land and he married. They stayed in their land as he worked and God blessed them with children. That boy kept cows, he added the land and it was big he gave it to the wife and asked her to dig it and plant maize, beans, and kales as she sells them. The wife did that. When she did that the husband continued to work in Nairobi and he retired and came back. He continued with his farming, he kept cows, rabbits; even sheep, he planted beans, maize and groundnuts and he kept rabbits. This boy continued to live and one season he planted maize and they didn't do well, he preferred planting groundnuts and he thought that they could do well. He planted gorundnuts and they did well he had kept a rabbit that he had hope in it. Wherever he wanted to go he used to send it; go and look the way my things are moving on, and the hare does goes. When the rabbit arrived at the farm it used to uproot the groundnuts and eats them. That man used to go to the farm with the rabbit and he asks it who uprooted the groundnuts and ate them? It refuses and says that it doesn't know. The man thought and he shared with the wife on what they could do to get hold of the thing that eats what they had planted. He asked people and they told him that they will give him the wisdom of catching something that eats his things. They told him to and make something on the farm that looks like a person (scarecrow), he kept glue on it and he put it on a tree. When he kept it on a tree he just stayed at home. The rabbit tha he was sending he asked it to go to the farm and see who was eating the groundnuts. When it went to the farm it started uprooting the groundnuts and then it looked up and saw someone that looked like a human being. It looked at it and asked, "you man you are the one that normaly eat groundnuts here?" that thing didn't answer him. It told him that it would beat him. That thing didn't speak and the rabbit had uprooted the groundnuts and it was carrying them. It came and said that it would beat him; he agrees that he is the one who eats their groundnuts. That thing didn't speak. The rabbit went and hit a blow on that thing; the hand got stuck. It gave it a kick the foot got stuck. It gave it another blow that got stuck; it hit it with the head that got stuck. When that man came he asked it since the time that he sent it; it is the one that was eating his groundnuts. Who gave it the groundnuts that it was carrying. It said, "I found this thing had dug them." He asked the rabbit "is this something that can uproot groundnuts? You are the one that has uprooted my groundnuts." That man took that rabbit and he liked walking with the child. He asked the child to take the rabbit home and give the mother to slaughter it; they will use it for dinner. The child came and tied the rabbit and then he went with it. While on the way he found others playing football, he took the rabbit and tied on a tree and then he began playing football. When he saw that it was late he came and untied the rabbit. The hare asked him, "you boy how did your father send you? Do you know how your father sent you" the boy said, "yes." The rabbit asked him to say the way the father sent him. The boy tried to think, hehad forgotten. He said, "I have forgotten, I do not know how he said." It said that the father said they go home and take a big cock they slaughter it, the father was coming with visitors' infact they were late. The child ran home with the rabbit. The rabbit asked him to untie it inorder to offer assistance since the father was almost about to arrive. He untied the rabbit. The boy told the mother, father said that she pick on a big cock among the others and slaughter it the visitors were coming. That woman told the rabbit to chase after the cock together with the boy because the husband was looking after his groundnuts that someone was stealing. They followed and caugt the cock, they slaughtered and cooked it and the rabbit told the boy that he had forgotten. He said that they spread a bed well where his visitor will sleep they spread the bed. They cooked fast, and cooked baked maize flour they ate their portion and they left the portion for the husband and the visitor that was coming. They ate and when the rabbit saw the man coming it went and slept on that bed, it stretched there and put dirt on it. When the man enterd the house he wondered what he was seeing and he asked the boy what he had sent him to do. He told him that he had sent him for a big cock he was coming with a visitor. He told him to that he had asked him to slaughter the rabbit. The rabbit ran away and left the man complaining. My story has ended there.</p>
<p>I have another story about a girl who died in her marriage.</p>
<p>There was a woman and the husband who gave birth to their baby gilrs and boys. That man and the wife were very rich. They took good care of their children and they educated them. When they educated them some of the girls got married, the boys got work and they began working. One girl didn't get married fast. She liked helping her parents to do work. That girl when the others got married she stayed at home and a boy came and asked her for a wedding. They asked the parents and they agreed. They brought the cows and paid for the dowry and the girl prepared for a wedding. When the day of wedding came, they came and took the girl to the church where they were doing the wedding. When they got there they began their wedding and it got finished. When it ended they gave in presents and they went home. They cooked at home and people ate well and went back to their homes. The gilr remained with the boy. They stayed and the parents went. When they went home the groom used to drink alcohol. When the man saw that the parents had gone he sniked and went to drink alcohol. When he came back he found the girl had sitted there silently. He began complaining asking the girl why she was still in the wedding gown and she had not washed the utensils and yet it was getting late at night. The wife kept quiet, he took her and beat her. The gilr ran to her parents in law. The mother in law asked her to sleep there and then she would go back the following day. She slept. The woman who was behind her in the wedding begged her and she went back. She went back to where she was married; she returned there. They went and asked what was the problem they found the man serious and sober, he claimed that he was not drunk he just spoke and the girl ran away. The girl lived there, she stayed for two months and she got married and gave birth to a baby. She gave birth to a firstborn child who was a boy; she perservired because she had said that even if God gave her a man to get married to she would perservire. That girl perservired, she added another second child. She added another child and the man was still taking alcohol. He used to drink and beat her thouroughly, she arn away to where she was born. When she ran to their home she stayed there for three days. The kids began crying saying that they wanted where their father was, they didn't want there. The girl perserired and the parents told her to perservire and go back to her marriage that girl went back, she stayed and that man was still beating her. She perservired and gave birth to a third born, the fourth child, the fifth child until she got the seventh child; she was just perserviring while that man was beating her. While she was perserviring that man beat her ery bad and there was funeral at the neighborhood. That girl ran away and went to the funeral. She went home with the children crying and it happened that the parents were sending her back. She went to the funeral and stayed there for three days and they buried that person. After they buried she was there and she wondered where she would go whether she could return to her home or where they ahd chased her. She saw his man coming and she hid and ased someone who showed her the man. He took the key and gave someone to take it to her and tell her to go t the house, since the girl was perserviring she took the key, went and opened the house. The children that were staying at her grandmother's home they came to their mother. That woman perservired, she educated her children from nursery, class 1 up to university. She had planted vegetables, maize, and beans as she educates them. Those children grew up and got jobs, the man had lived on alcohol and beating the wife. The alcohol killed him and he left that wife who struggled with her children. She stayed and the children got jobs and they began taking care of her. The woman lived until she died and left the children. These children were at home the boys got work and the gilrs got married. The woman died and left the home while it was stable. It is teaching us that we young people when we see a problem we should perservire and take care of our home because there are coming days when you will enjoy.</p>

<p>There was a man and the wife. The man was called Kalasimba. The man married a wife and they gave birth to 11 children. He stayed with the wife and both of them were taking alcohol. They liked planting things like pumpkin in the whole land. They had warned the children even if they get hungry they should not eat the pumpkin. These children used to stay hungry and where they had gone they were taking alcohol because where they were taking alcohol from there was meat and the children were staying hungry they could come and look for what they could cook for the children to eat. There was a day the children were so hungry and they had been warned from eating the pumpkin and if one ate all of them would die; they were three and they were not allowed to take. The elder child asked the others to go and take them even if they would die. They took the pumpkins they cooked and ate. When they ate they all died. The neighbors wondered what they could do since all the children had died. They looked around and it happened that they had not known where the husband and the wife had gone to take alcohol. They called a bird and they told it that they wanted to send it because it would fly, they told it to look for where people were mummering and where the alcohol was. The bird agreed and it flew and found where people were mummering and it knew that was the place where alcohol was. When the bird got there it began to sing.</p>

<p>I have another story of a cat and a rat.</p>
<p>The cat and the rat were great friends; they loved each other; wherever they were going they used to go together even when the cat was going to a ceremony she used to ask the rat to escort her. There was a day the cat asked the rat to escort her to her ceremony. When they got there the cat asked the rat to escort her to a wedding, they went and arrived. The wedding happedned and they slept there; they stayed and slept there. At the wedding they began cooking food and eating, they roasted meat and cooked all sorts of meals; doughnuts, rice and for the cat the friend said that she loved her and she wanted to roast meat for her. They roasted and when they roasted they brought it to the cat that had her friend outside called rat. They ate that meat and they found that it was very sweet. When they ate the cat told the rat to pack the remaining one they will go with it and eat it from home. They packed their meat and when they packed it they got home. When they arrived at home the cat told the rat that they will be eating their meat slowly and she kept it. When she kept she told the rat that she wants to go and bring milk they drink, the rat asked the cat to go and bring it. the cat went to look for the milk but it didn't get it really needed and it got out of there when it was very late. And the rat went and bites the meat and it realized that it was very nice. The rat ate that meat and finished it. When she finished the cat came with the milk and they drank and finished. When they finished the cat told her that she wanted them to take their meat and eat. She went and looked at the shelf where she had kept and she found that it was not there. She asked the rat where she had kept the meat and she said that the meat was just there. The cat said that she was going to look for the dinner but when she comes back she should fin her meat there. She went to look for the food and she came back and found that the rat had hid herself. She used to go on the sides to look for the rat and the rat runs away to the bushes. The cat kept quiet and went home, cooked and she came back again. She used to look for the rat and the rat hides in bushes. One day the cat met the rat and told her, "you give me my meat, if you do not give me my meat our friendship is over." The rat said, "I just bite the meat and I found that it was good and I realized that it got finished." She told her that she will give her back she since she was the one invited and the meat belonged to her and the rat was just escorting her, she asked her if she had told her to eat the whole meat hence she was to bring back the meat. The rat told her that she ate the meat and finished. The cat told the rat that since that day their friendship was over and she will be looking for her wherever she is. When she is away she runs the house and if she happens to see her she will eat her. When the cat finds the rat it eats her and when the rat is in the house it normaly stays well that is all.</p>
