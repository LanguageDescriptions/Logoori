Valetelela nukwigitsa tsinyimbu, vavalitsa avandu va vavugani navo, vasiahe iganisa. Vatsitsa muviselelo, vimililanga amavugano ga vang'elele. Vatumangwa mu mavugano gu mutsiganisa tsindi. Vahana vihanwa viosi ku livugana. Kutula kumihiga salasini na moja kuduka kumihiga sitini jia valikanga mihiga jiaa hagati ku liviluka liavo.Valange avaaminifu avakulundu.Vaveye na vana mihiga yiji jiali jiukuyanzitsa miandu vujila vutii. Mihiga jio vogeli vunyingi valeka ulwana mu kitabu cha vakolosai 13:11. Vali vukwitsuliza vindu.Yaga nigo amalago gavahelwa gakolwe kuvoo. Valinde amavugano,valinde imiandu ji livugana, valinde kutumwa kusingilila amakuva, vatumangwe kushila tsibarwa, viselelo, uvukwi, valinde avageni vave avilwazi kuli pastors. Avigitsi vavikwa mutsikamati tsie livugana kutula ku mihiga sitini na moja kuduka ku mihiga tsamanini avasakulu. Limanya linyingi, avadoto kuvugilila mihiga jio vutuji anoho vudaka, lilama ni vaveye na visukulu valamanga visukulu kwitsulitsa vindu litanga kogeha. Mihiga jiu kuvika vindu mu vugono kijira na vasakulu, mihiga jiu kugavula miandu vali na memory yeneyo kukola ndio kuvandu vavo va vamenyi navo. Amalago genyekananga gakolwe kuvo nikuli ndi: vigitsi vang'elele vulindi, vasalilanga, valangangwa mu misango jiosi, amita gavo gatumikilangwa kuhulilitsa kugulika vindu, ukwitsulitsilaku, vahelwangwa uluyali, valange vielolelo ku valondi vavo. Niganyalikanga  vavika vogono vwe livugana mu miandu jiavo. Vang'oda vitabu. Kutula kumihiga tsamanini na moja nu kutsia igulu vali avahoma. Mihiga jiene yijio jiali jie lisosa kutula kuvuyinzili anoho imiyinzi si vanyala kugendagenda dave. Vali vanyala kwivilila vindu kijira vusakulu, kijira tsinganagani tsiavo tsiali tsingeekeke. Lihulila na lilola lialange likeekeke, valangi ni tsindolo tsinyingi. Yaga nigo gakolangwa kuvoo: vahelangwa oluyali, vavolelangwa ku gekolechi. Vasanditsangwa ku mihiga jia nyasaye yavaha.Valekelangwa nu vukumi anoho mirembe. Livugana lia nyasaye liveye uvuhambani vwa vakristo vahonywa yavo avavolanga nyasaye aveye lihonywa liavo. Kitabu cha Isaya 12:2. Likuva mukristo litulananga kuling'ana liu lugelechi ex-krikto. Vigitsi va yesu vatanga kulanga vakuristayo mu Antioka Vikolwa11:26 vali ni vamala kuvalwa vakuristo. Avakuristayo vedinyilitsanga kunyola vaduki ku vindu via imbli kuli Paul yalola Mbafilipi 3:12-15. Soma Vagalatia 4:8-9, Waefeso 4:14. Paulo yiganilitsanga navavolela ndi vavuli kuvaa kandi kuli avana vadoto, kuvula kulonda uvugadi yaani vuveyi vwu kogotitsa kuvolwa vagelihe ku megitso ga vandu kijira kuveye ni miandu jia nyasaye. Wagalatia 4:3-7 kuhenze ku liteva liali livoyange kwilananga ndina mu megitso ga kale nukukili kugwa avakuristayo henza ku gatenyekanga mu lisabato. Liyinzila mulisabato kuli lilima, viashara, zingina tsia kusia, kuvolelana uvukwi, amavugano ga utetezi, lilomba tsimbego, lilohitsa lia kugulana vindu. Serikali yetu ya Kenya ifunganga tsi ofisi jumapili navutswa kunyi vakuristayo kwavugula lidiku yili kuvaa litakatifu kuli lidiku lia jumapili kuvola agiligali muganisa, tsikamati tsie livugana tsikolekanga nitsienyechi kukolwa na pastors mu mavugana gavo. Litovola avasanji, ku vuyinzili vwe livugana liletanga tsihili anoho vulina, amativuli ge tsibarua gakolangwa nu vutima vujila kusala kutsio. Nivavula kuhana vwimilili vwa roho mulitovola liavo liosi lilolana nende lilohitsa lihila lita liavukana mu tsinyimbu kali valala vakidinyanji ku mima jiavo kuli likevwa. Kali vasanji valala vali nivatia kulia mutsinyumba tsia vasanji vavo yaani navasigu. Avasanji halala nivenyanga tsikamati tsie iganisa sivahelangwa mitungu mba. Avasanji vali nivayanza kogonela na magovi ge vihanwa via nyasaye kali omuoyo gwo kukonya vandi gwakeha. Vakristayo kali tsiganisa tsiageha kunyola avasanji. Kali tsi-schools tsiagelitsa kukola kololekitsa vukuristayo nu kuvula kusanditsa kuvindu via kunyolanga. Nandio vindu yivi ni vindu vimanyianga kukwilanilanga mu mang'ana ga kale. Avamission lwa vatsa mukivala yiki vamanya valomba vandu nivageha tsingulu mu mundu witu wa hagati (inner spirit) soma Waifeso 3:16-19 kuduka kunyola kristo amenyi mu kwinye kunangwa kukole nyasaye aveye lihonya lietu nu kwitsulitswa nu vuyanzi vwivwe. Kokola ki aduki mu mioyo jiutu, lidasa tsingulu mu mundu witu wa hagati. Migitso ga konyoye gakonyi kunye konyola kolola ndi kwageha tsingulu mu mundu witu wa hagati nicho kivune kwilananga mu migitsu ni mima jia kale kristo niye unyala kukudasa kunye tsingulu niva amenya mu mioyo jyitu. Yesu yavola alasava  dada naye alakuha mukonyi undi ave ni kunyi halala mu mihiga ni mihiga naye ni roho wa giligali. Yohana 14:16-17 navutsa sa anyala kukuha mukonyi huyu kuduka kutange yesu halala na dada nyasaye vavulika ku huyu ugumiye kumuyanza nu kugumila amalago gege. Yohana 14:15 umaliyi kokonywa, Yohana 14:21, Yesu na nyasaye vamenya mu uyu umali kuhonywa Yohana 14:23, roho mtakatifu sa anyala kwingila mu kwinye vujila lisala Yesu yasala Yohana aduke kumbadisa kijira yenya kudukitsa lilago. Mariko 3:13-16 inyuma we libadiswa roho yika kuye kuli likuulu Matayo 3:16 munzila ya galaha. Avakuristayo vanyinge vanyala kubadiswa navutswa vavuli kuhevwa roho mtakatifu Yohana 21:21,24,29. Roho tsiveye tsingulu tsiu kulola vulungi mu likola lilio, roho mtakatifu si anyala kumenya mu mwoyo gutali munifu .Mwoyo gutali munifu kulolekanga mdedekele inyinga ya guveye mudinyu, guveye mulwale nende inzala, guveye mu magelitso nu vuhimwa. Roho mtakatifu yika ku yesu kuli likuulu galaha. Yika ku vigitsi va yesu kuli mulilu guduke kusamba vuchafu vwavo vwosi, Vikolwa 2:1-4 kihanwa cha roho kingilanga mundu wumusi mwitu nikukoli yaga nilieganila. Libadiswa, lisamifwa uvwoni Vikwolwa 2:38-39 nacho kiveye makuyu amalahi Wagalatia 5:22 avakristo ve liva yili vanyala kovola nyasaye aveye lihonyia liavo. Roho mtakatifu ilolekanga ahimbi lwa koveye nu vuyanzi ku vandu kijira nyasaye ni vuyanzi, nu vusangali ku gamali kukoleka ni milembe mu tsinganagani nu mwoyo vujila vulwani ni lidunyilana, nu vwikutsili nu vuhocha ni lisuvila liveye kulwanda lwa kristo. Lwa George Fox yalola roho mtakatifu ahimbi naye yiginga nu vusangali yali roho mtakatifu yimilila Paul kutsia mutsing'endo Amereka ni yimila kutsia kuvugana na makuva ga nyasaye vujira uvuti. Nyinga lwa vahindi vakanyu vali vasigu ko vo yali ho mutakatifu wajila Daudi navola kali ningenda mukivanda chi chilili chu lukutsu sinyala kutia kindu mba. Yali roho mtakatifu wimilila Paul kutsia mutsingendo tsiosi vujira uvuti. Roho mutakatifu niye wimilila avamisheni vu kutanga mu elfu moja mia tisa na mbili kuduka mu kivala kinu. Mihiga jikola jinde amusini imbili kwame amakuyu gi lieganila, Vikolwa 2:38, musingi gwi lisuvila yili guve ku vana vitu, lisala ni livugana nu kokola miluka jiosi (Vikolwa 2:39) Na vandi vakili kulangwa kuhambane na vandi vosi ihale mu vivala vindi ni tsidini tsindi.

<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Christian life</p>
<p>My name is Benjamin Egadwa Okodi, I am praising the stories about people's connection with God. They are assisting the christian life, the growth of christians and I want to say this:</p>
<p>God made a man in his own likeness. Someone like Adam who was like a child and he grew. He was made as expected like a pot that has been moulded fully. What is following is saying like this: the growth of the body, it is brought up until the age of fifteen then they are taken to Sunday school. They follow their parents to church and they take the offering themselves. From the age of 16 to 30 these are believers. They take in the teachings, they believe and like the promise other than the critics. They are doing this to teach and bring believers to the church. They read to the believers the word of God. </p>
<p>Kutula kumihiga salasini na moja kuduka kumihiga sitini jia valikanga mihiga jiaa hagati ku liviluka liavo.Valange avaaminifu avakulundu.Vaveye na vana mihiga yiji jiali jiukuyanzitsa miandu vujila vutii. Mihiga jio vogeli vunyingi valeka ulwana mu kitabu cha vakolosai 13:11. Vali vukwitsuliza vindu.Yaga nigo amalago gavahelwa gakolwe kuvoo. </p>
<p>They are brought up through songs, they count people that they worship with and fill the church. They attend weddings. They lead yourth service. They are send to other churches. They give all sorts of presents to the church. From the age of 31 up to 60 they submit their middle age life to their growth. They were the leading believers. Those who had children, they were happy. They leave the childhood, in the book of Colosians 13:11 was for remembering things. These are the instructions that they are given to work on. They look after the church. They look after the wealth of church and lead things. They will be send to issue letters for wedding, dowry, and they take care of visitors like pastors. The teachers who were put in charge of commities for church were between the age of 60 up to 80 years were old men. They knew much, they had the memory of splitting wealth to the people whom they were staying with.  </p>
<p>The laws that were expected to be fulfilled by them were like this: they were to teach young people leadership, they were praying for people. They were invited to all the meetings. Their names were used to call and name things. They were given inheritance, they were good examples to their followers. They were holding the church, they quoted scriptures. From the age of 81 onwards these were mature people, those age were meant for rest, from those age they were not able to walk. </p>
<p>They could easily forget things because they were old. Because their thoughts were wide. Hearing and earning was little. They had long sleep. These is what was given to them: they were given inheritance, they were told what had happened. They were appreciated for the years that God had given them. They were left with inheritance and peace. When the church of God was at union of christ, those who got healed used to say that God is their healer. The book of Isaiah 12:2 the word christ is from a greek word ex-kristo. The disciples of Jesus began to call christians in Antioka </p>
<p>ACTS 11:26 they had finished to be christians. They strived hard to reach to the top like Paul who saw in Philipians 3:12 - 15, Galatians 4:14. Paul made them to repent and he told them not to be like children so that they are not deceived. They were told to be clever because we have the inheritance of God. Galatians 4:3:7 we look at the word that was saying, how are we getting to the christianity and what is required on the sabath day. </p>
<p>Working on the sabath day like digging, business and posho mill, agreeing on the dowry terms, meetings, agreement on selling items. The government of Kenya closes the office on Sunday since we christians take it as a holy day, we speak the truth in church on Sunday. The church commities are held on that day by pastors from their church. </p>
<p>Appointing church members to do church work promotes friendship. The response of letters is done by anger if they have not prayed on them. If they are not guided by the spirit in their doing, they differ in songs even others are still stuck to their culture like circumcision. Even some church members are afraid of eating meals from their follow church members because they are enemies. When church memebers have finished working they are not paid since they have the reward of God even the heart of assistsing others has reduced.</p>
<p>For the christians the churches have reduced number of members. The schools have emphasized on christianity and thanked the church for what it is doing. These are things that show that we are returning to the past things. When the missionery came they made us to reduce the inner spirit, read the book of Ephesians 3:16-19 we find that christ stays in us so that we make God our savior and filled with his joy.</p>
<p>What shall we do so that he gets into our hearts, adding strength to our inner heart. The teachings that we have received are helping us to realize that we have reduced strength in our hearts and that is why we are getting back to the old teachings of Christ who is able to add us if he is staying in our hearts. Jesus said he who ask from the father will be given there is a helper who is with us for years and he is the holy spirit. John 14:16-17 but he cannot give us the helper until we begin with Jesus and God the father, then the helper will come in.</p>
<p>we love and take heed of his commandments. John 14:15 who has been assisted, John 14:21, Jesus and God are staying in the one who has been saved. John 14:23 holy spirit cannot get into our lives without prayer, Jesus was baptized by John inorder to fulfill the law. Mark 3:13-16 after the baptism holy spirit stood behind him like a thunder. Mathew 3:16 in a slowly way. Many christians can be baptized but not receive holy spirit John 21:21, 24 ,29. The spirit has the power to look the things that you are doing if they are right. The holy spirit cannot live in a heart that is not clean.  </p>
<p>A heart that is not clean, appears to be weak when it is strong, it is sick and hungry, that is in trials and temptations. The holy spirit entered into Jesus like a thunder slowly. It got into the disciples of Jesus like a burning fire that burns all the dirt. Acts 2:1-4 the gift of holy spirit gets into someones life if he repents. Baptism brings forgiveness of sin Acts 2:38-39 are good things, Galatians 5:22 christians in this condition can say God is their savior. The holy spirit is seen near when we have happiness with others because God is is our joy. It happens in peace, in thoughts and without war and quarrel together with patience. Our faith is on the rock of Jesus.</p>
<p>When George Fox received holy spirit, he was happy because he had received holy spirit, he led Paul in his ways and America ran to christianity without fear. When the indians were at quarrel with them. And David said as I walk through the valleys and the shadow of God I fear nothing. It was holy spirit who led Paul in all ways without fear. The holy spirit is the one who guided the first missionary since 1902 up to this world.</p>
<p>In the book of Acts 2:38, the foundation of believers is in our children, prayers is by doing actions. Acts 2:39 and the others are not called together with others from other countrys. The issues of christians Acts 2:3 we should give thanks to God's work. Acts 2:45 we should assist others to promote unity together. Acts 2:42 we are oftenly given holy teachings. Acts 2:42 if possible the whole house should be of christians. Acts 26:28-29  God will add those who are getting saved.</p>
<p>The actions of a christian begins by:</p>
<p>Thanking God since the year 1976, and also he gave us the opportunity to live in this millenium of wisdom and if you take people to the darkness they won't like it. If you imagine the way people were staying in 1970 , and in 1990 when they returned to the house, those days there was smoke and a poor bed, you cannot accept to go back there.</p>
<p>They shared milk when they were together, they drunk the milk and ate together as brothers. They went to the river with pots and they drew water using gourd. They removed the scum from water then they fetched it. They slept on banana leaves, they ate bananas, porridge from the gourd. They also ate baked maize flour and chicken. They ate healthy meals. Other went to sell stones to a far place while walking. They are the people who changed and moved to the light. Look at the Mathew 5:33 the people who seek for the kingdom of God they do not get back.</p>
<p>The seedling of a tree is very small but when the tree grows it becomes huge and other trees in the forest are reproduced and they also become huge. The birds like making nests on them or staying in peacing on the tree. They like building their nests inside because of the sun, rain and other enemies. The word of God is a seed that is planted so that other people can get to hear the word of God in their hearts. When we grow as christians that is when the tree grows. </p>
<p>The christians are the branches. John 15:5 the birds are like those who want to get shelter like the poor, lame, blind, orphans, fools and weak. For that reason people should love God for his leadership in heaven so that they live many years in this world.</p>
<p>Thank you.  </p>
