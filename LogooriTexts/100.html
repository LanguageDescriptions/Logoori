<p>Mimi ni Henry Nyaleso Munangwe na ndayanza kumolomela ku liiva lia vandu vitu vatula liveye kumolomela kolondekana ku nyinga ya kavili na suviri ndamalitsa ku lyenya liene lia ndenya.</p>
<p>Kutura hambale kutsa hadiriji hano valogoli vahama vuli inyinga ku ndaduka mu ngoma ya valogoli lwa ndamoloma lwali. Na kalunu ndamolomela engoma ya valogoli kuli mulogoli yamenya mu na avaana veve, ni tsihiri sa tsiaranda, ni liva, ni limenya lya mulogoli ha valogoli vaveye inyinga yinu valogoli kuli varanda mu. Engoma ya valogoli ni ligono lyavo ndamala ku limoloma liene yili ni ndulaho ni nonda kuli vamenya. Engoma ya valogoli yalombwa nu kuvikwa mu kiguru keveye mmagina manyinge galomba tsimbinga ni tsimbangaywa tsinyinge. Misara jiamera hakiguru tsana jilombanga kucho mulitu gwa evologoli maragoli hills Inabwongo yila. Mu i nyinga ndala vwalombwa mu vogono mu vikkaa vivaga. Mwi miruka jiakolelangwa. Engoma ni indumba enene yalombwa ku muluka gwa kukola uvusalisi vwa valogoli gwe engoma ya kubangwa yalangilitsanga nu muhumu gwa yo munene. Vudinyilitsa liegomba anoho ilienya lia mulogoli. Na kuvaletera vindu via vadakilwa anoho kuvagutira vasigu vari nu vuhimwa ku vo. Engoma yavatsangwa ku musala mudinyu kandi umutovore. Lisero lie engoma yalombelangwa yalange yi inyama yu mbulimu yi ligondo liakanyu anoho lidaarinya. Mbitira lialange lisero lie embogo anoho inzagiliku lie engoma na lisarisa lia kafwa ma ehenzitswa lovega lwe imadioli. Lihigita anoho lihumukwa lie engoma si liahulilika vulahi ligali  ku vandu vali shimbe nayo dave. Vandu vali ihale nayo yivo vahulilanga vulahi umuhumu gwa yo mulahi. Valogooli vahulilanga engoma yavo nihumukanga nu muhumu munene vayanza ligali ma valala vavaa ni lisuvila valogoli valanyola tsingavi tsindahi kuli tsiukuvaa nu lwalo lwu vwivulu, kuvaa nu muhiga mulahi gwi ligesa viukulia vinyinge, kuguta mahe ga vasigu vavo.

Ku vaguga na valogoli vaveye ho kalunu vaduka mu kenya ya imadioli himbe mihiga jiavita shirini na tano hali salasini anoho kuvita. Yiji jidukanga kuvita imihiga mia saba na amisni jiavita. Mu livalitsa lia Erick Becker gamanyia ndi valogoli vaduka mu nu kutanga klimenya mu kenya yi imadioli mu muhiga jiali hagati na elfu moja miambili salasini na tano na elfu moja mia mbili shirini na tano. Na umuhandichi undi Gideon Were yali mwigitsi wa history mu University ya Nairobi ku mihiga minyinge kandi wi limanya lidukilu mu masomo ga mang'ana ga kale yahandika mu kitabu chiche cha History of the Abaluhya of Western Kenya ndi mu mihiga  jiali hagati ha elfu moja mia tano tisaini na nane na elfu moja mia saba salasini na tatu; valogoli, vanyore, vatiriki, visukha na vidako vali nivamenyi mu vivala via vaveye mu kalunu mu kenya yi imadioli. Kuvalitsila ku mihiga jie vikevo vya valogoli shirini na mbili viatanga kulubuni kwilana inyuma ku vikevo vihindila kuduka ku kwekoya galolekanga ndi mu mihiga jiali hagati na elfu moja mia mbili na arubaini na elfu moja mia inne sitini valogoli vali vamenyi ivulogoli wa vaveye kuduka lelo. Vakulundu valogoli vadinyilitsa ndi: vikevo vihindila shirini na mbili yivi viali ho muhiga gwa elfu moja mia tisa vutswa ni gukikiri kuduka (1900). Mu vikevo yivi avandu vakevangwa ni vaveye vahindila. Mu vikevo vilala vandu valala vakevangwa ni vamara kwivula umwana mulala, vavili anoho vavaga. Na mu vikevo vindi umwana yakevangwa ekekevo kilala na ise. Mu liva kuli yili livalitsa lyi mihiga yiji livikanga liavukana lie mihiga hagati ha shirini na salasini; hagati he kekevo kilala ni kindi. Vikevo vyamanyikana ni vyanyoleka vutswa kijira ilitsulitsa lia vakulundu vali nivavimanyilitsa vutsa mu mitwi na kandi vilala ku vyo vialivilika. Niva ivivilika vinyala kwitsulika vinyala kwilanyia mihiga yiji inyuma kali kuduka shimbe ku muhiga gwa elfu moja gwa valogoli vali ni vamenyi mu kenya ya imadioli. Yaga nigo kumanyililitsa vulahi: valogoli na vandu vivulana mu vunyinge na vasalanila mu vivala vie lilova liosi.

<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Drum of maragoli</p>
<p>I am Henry Nyareso Munangwe and I will like to speak to speak about the lifestyle of people where they came from am speaking the second part and I believe that I will finish.</p>
<p>We came from Mbale and arrived here in Tiriki. Maragooli keep on shifting from one place to another. Today I will speak on how the maragooli used to stay with his children. And the way the sub-tribes spreaded. His lifestyle and the way he is living at the presnt time. </p>
<p>His drum was made and kept at the top of the hill, that has many stones. Trees grew on the top of that hill and it made a forest that is the maragoli forest. Sometimes they made their place in three stages. This is where the rituals were done. It is a large drum that was made for the purpose of prayer. Whenever a drum was played it had a significant meaning that was so important. It emphasizes on the demands of the maragoli. It also brings things that they lack or to defeat their enemies in war. </p>
<p>The drum was made from a hard and a selected type of a tree. The skin that the drum was made from was from a wild animal. It was from an antelope, and after the prayer the drum was put back and also facing the western side. When it was played, the sound was not pleasing to the people who were near. People who were far are the ones who were hearing it well. The maragoli were very happy whenever they heard their drum playing and they knew that they will have blessing, to have a prosperous year of harvesting a lot and also to defeat their enemies. Sometimes the one who was  leading in prayer gave instructions of the drum to the elders of great respect then they pass it to people.</p>
<p>The leader of the prayer used to call people in times of planting. When he was going to do the rituals he was escorted by three elder men. When they got there the elders used to remain outside and he entered inside. He passed the first and the second place and when he got to the third place he found coals that were kept in the horns.</p>
<p> He could then apply the coals on the forehead and then he begins to do the rituals. The maragoli who used to go to the hill for the purpose of praying, they did it three times in a year. During the dry season, the planting season and also when they wanted to harvest, they went to pray. During the rituals the leader used to light fire at the altar, then he burns some of the items to be planted then they do the planting. When they burned the items and the smoke goes up the maragoli were very happy, because they knew their sacrifice will have a good feed back. </p>
<p>Whenever there was a problem, of rain falling down, with hailstorm, or people loosing their cattles because of death, the leader used to take a white hen and burns it at the altar so that the watchdogs can have a sweet diet and feel happy. So that death and destruction should not be there, it was to leave the maragooli. A person who was appointed as the leader of the prayer didn't have any scar or issues. He was pure without any blamish, one who had not killed, one was not a thief, adultery, witch, a person who cheats or the one who has a scar. </p>
<p>This type of a person was not appointed. All the maragooli were following the instructions of the leader for prayer, he is the one wh had powers over the maragooli. They looked at him, with the aim of receiving blessings. In wars they had leaders who were harsh and and confident in the war.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am talking about the maragooli and his children. The maragooli are luhya and also bantu. They started their life from the western side of Kenya. In maragooli and other luhya tribes the maragooli had a bonefire in the village, where the elders were sitting and making there plans for the village and the people who were there. I was like a small parliament. All the luhya tribes had a place where cases were solved in the village, and the term lusha is where they got the name Luhya. </p>
<p>The twenty six tribes of Luhya and there lifestyle began from western side and they were Banyala, Basamia, Kabarasi, Batachoni, Idakho, Isukha, Tiriki, Banyore and Maragooli. The other tribes that stayed together with the Luhya are the Teso and the Kalejin of kenya. The people who made the maragooli sub-tribes are the ones who were born when the maragooli got arrived in the western side of Kenya. But their growth and maturity have not been well determined. They also had relatives and friends. In addition to that, their children whom they came to stay with in western side, they were like the parents of the groups of people that they were staying with.</p>
<p>They made there stay in maragoli. These people were counted as the maragooli children. In the counting of the houses or the sub-tribes they found out that they were 39 houses. In addition to that the grandchildren of maragooli are also counted together with the maragooli children. The elder child of maragooli was known as Sali. This is the one who made up the house of Vasali. The grandchildren of maragooli are magetsa who made the house of Vamagetsa, Mukoyani made the house Vakoyani. Mbaya made the house of Vammbaya, Vutsutsu made the house of Vavutsutsu, the other name of Vutsutsu was Kehege. The child of Mbaya or the grandchild of Sweta made the house of the Vasweta.

<p>The fourth child of Mulogooli was called Mmave this is the one who remained in western side as he took care of the drum. From Mbale to Imatsigulu this was called the south Maragoli. This is the one who gave birth and formed the house of Vamave. The children of Vamave or the grandchildren of mulogoli is Gonda who made the house of Vagonda, Mtambe made the house of Vamutambe, Nondi made the house of Vanondi and Logovo made the house of Valogovo.</p>

<p>The other one was called Itavati who formed the house of Vitavati. The thirty nine houses were of the children and the grandchildren. In most cases a girl is recognized and counted from the house where she got married. This is the reason to why the names of the girls in maragoli are not mentioned or recognized. One of the names that were recognized among girls is Kavogoi. It is praising the girl. The other names for girls in maragoli are Kadesa, Anzemo, Minayo, Afandi, Lumadi, Aseyo, Lumayo, Minyoso, Andeso, Mmbone, Musimbi, Kamonya, Muhonja and more. All the names for the houses were named after the person who formed it. </p>
<p>Sometimes these names were from people who belonged to other sub-tribes and they got married in maragoli. Sometimes these names were used to separate the villages of the people who named them. This person used the sub-tribe of the woman in the village, to separate the child of one woman from the other. We are looking at the age of the maragoli. The age of maragoli since he started staying in western part of Kenya is not recognized. </p>
<p>One of the student called Erick Barker was the officer during the colonial period who were staying in Kenya, wrote in his short stories of History of Nyanza that the maragoli of the present time are between the age of 24 and 25 years. In most cases the father is at the age of 30 years older than the son.  From Erick Beckers estimation, it seems like the maragoli arrived and started staying in western part of Kenya between the age of 1235 and 1225. Another writter by the name Gideon Were was a teacher at the Unversity of Nairobi for many years also wrote his book about the history of the Abaluhya of western Kenya also wrote the age of 1598 and 1733; the maragoli, Nyore, Tiriki, Isukha and Idakho stayed in the places where they are staying now the western part of Kenya.   </p>
<p>We are counting from the 22 circumcision ceremonies of the maragoli, it seems like between the year of 1240 and 1460 they were staying in maragoli where they are. The elders strengthened this: the older circumcision period was in 1900. During this circumcision people were circumcised while they are mature. In some circumcisions people were circumcised after giving birth to one child, two or three children. In some circumcision a child was circumcised by the father. This is between the age of 20 and 30 and that is between one circumcision period and the other one. The circumcision was known because the elders remembered it, and knew it offhead. If they were forgotten they could take the years behind, even up to the year of 1000, when the maragoli were staying in western part of Kenya. This shows well that Maragoli are people who give birth to many children. And they pray for each other all over the places in Kenya. These days some of the maragoli have migrated to America and Europe.</p>
<p>In 1960 and 1970 most of the maragoli migrated to Uganda and they stay there up to now and others are staying in Zambia, and there are many maragoli who are staying there. There are many maragoli in Tanzania and they pass through Lake Victoria, and they use the Migori, Sirare, Tarime because they are many in Bware, Migori and South Nyanza. There are many maragoli who have migrated to Trans Nzoia Kitale and Uasin Gishu in Rift valley, because they want to look for a shelter because of hunger. Maragoli are also staying in most of the towns in Kenya. </p>
<p>In most cases we follow the number of people in the land of Kenya. The maragoli at the current moment they are the third people in population of Kenya. When the Luhya people unite they can appoint a strong leader, as they say in unity we stand, in disunity we fall. It is like that for the much or the few that I have for the maragoli.</p>
