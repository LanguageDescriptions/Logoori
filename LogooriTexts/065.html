<p>Long time ago we had a woman who got married to a man. They stayed together and they got a girl by the name Cinderella. They stayed for long time and the mother to this girl died. She left the girl while she was still very young. The man stayed like that, he watched after the child and wondered what he could do with the child in that situation. He married another wife. As they stayed together they were blessed with two children who were girls. The girls were brought up and they were educated but Cinderella was not educated. The other girls learned with a lot of resentfulness.</p>
<p>They used to look down upon this girl Cinderella. They left all the work for her to do. Even going to the river, fetching firewood. She could come and cook while they are seated. There work was to beautify them, they make their hair while their sibling is working. She continued to work as she persevered. It came a time when the son of a king wanted to marry a wife. He wondered how he could find a girl. They made a party, and they asked all the girls in the village to gather themselves somewhere. The son of the king wanted all the girls to go there.</p>
<p>Now the two sisters to Cinderella made their hair, they prepared themselves, they did pedicure. Cinderella asked her mother if she could go there and the others laughed at her. The mother said that she should do work, fetch water in all the buckets. Cinderella fetched the water and asked her to go to the party since she had finished filling all the buckets with water. The mother said "you are not going, have you looked for firewood?" she went and looked for firewood. She asked her again for permission but her mother refused and poured sand into millet, then she asked her to pick the chaff from the millet first then she will be free to go to the party.  Cinderella sat down then she started to cry as she removed the chaff. While she was doing that, the birds came and started removing the chaff too. They assisted her, then she went and they asked her if she had finished. The mother told her that she didn't have a cloth to use for the party. The girl left. When she left, her mother who had died brought her a small car, miraculously. They were not vehicles like the current ones, they were vehicles made of wood and a horse pulled them. She went and she now had good clothes and shoes. She went and she heard a voice telling her that she go and when it reaches four o'clock she should leave the place. At four o'clock she will get back to her normal status. She should not delay.</p>
<p>She went and found people dancing as the keyboard was being played. When they looked through the window they said, "Cinderella is coming and she is so beautiful." They marveled at her and the son of the king said that she was the one that he needed. People continued to sing and dance. They brought soda, they took beer while inside, they celebrated and there was joy inside. After a while, something came and talked to the girl and she left the place very fast, she went outside. One of her shoe got off. The vehicle came and she jumped inside, and she was taken home. While she was near home, the vehicle disappeared and she remained in her normal status. She was dressed in her normal clothes. The girls started to say that they had beautify themselves and they thought that they were the best, now another girl came and she ran away. They didn't even realize that the girl who ran away was Cinderella. She continued to do her work in the kitchen. They explained to their mother the way things were. There came a day and the son of the king said that the girl that he had seen, the shoe belong to her and they should move around the village, allowing all the girls to put on the shoe and the one whose feet will fit in they should come with her.</p>
<p>The village elders began to move around with the shoe. They moved around homes as the girls tried to fit their feet inside the shoe. They tried to put it on but it seems like their feet didn't fit inside. Their mother took a stone and tried to reduce the shoe by hitting it. They struggled but it didn't fit. And she said that there was no other girl that they could see. They said that she was dirty and she couldn't even leave the homestead. The village elder refused and said that they allow her to come. The girl came and there was miracles and her feet fitted inside the shoe. When they came with her the son of the king said that she was the one. They went and prepared a party. They said that they want to do a wedding. Now when the parents were called and the other girls were jealous, the father and the mother went. Her stepmother pretended to be happy but she was jealous in her heart. They did the wedding. Cinderella stayed with the boy and she continued to assist her people.</p>
<p>The story ends there.</p>
