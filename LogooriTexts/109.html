<p>Ni yago ganyanzi kuvavolela ku.</p>
<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Circumcision</p>
<p>I am Henry Nyareso Munangwe and we are here at Jidereri. I want to say a few words according to the way our grandfather used to do things and their way of life.</p>
<p>It is the culture of the maragoli to circumcise. They had a separate way of counting, which is different from the one of today. Months, weeks, days and time. The maragoli used to know the maturity of people based on their initiation age-group. According to maragoli culture, if a boy had not been circumcised he was considered as a child. Even if he grew to be a mature person he was not considered as one or a real man. Circumcision in maragoli makes one look different from a child and enters into an adulthood stage. Each circumcisio had it's name. The name of circumcision was used as the age-group name for the initiates. All the initiation names had a meaning.</p>
<p>PREPARATION FOR THE CIRCUMCISION</p>
<p>Initiation was a meeting for blessings to the maragoli or to the luhya who are bantu and all the others who heard that this ceremony was done. The maragoli used to prepare for initiation in all ways. Most of the times they prepared for initiation during the harvest season, when there is enough food in the world. In comparison with the present days, most of the initiation was done in august and september, or periods near these months. For the boys who were to be circumcised, they were prepared food that they will use during the initiation and for the old men, they organized for their beer.</p>
<p>For the initiates they prepared hen that they would give to the person who will circumcise them. Initiation season is the season that the leader of prayer, considered to be the best season. It was a season when there was no war.</p>
<p>THE CIRCUMCISION SURGEON</p>
<p>This is a person who knows the initiation practice well. This person had a team of his assistants, some of his assistants were playing the drums. "Indindi" is a drum that is played to alert people about initiation and it has a culture that is followed while playing it. Other assistants were carrying the hens that he was given and the others assisted him to hold the coward initiates, who were disturbing during the circumcision or trying to run away but they didn't manage to escape. The eyes of the circumcision surgeon made the initiate to be afraid and calm during the initiation. During this season that is when circumcision was done. </p>
<p>All the people used to prepare for the day of circumcision. Men were near to assist the circumcision surgeon to hold the intiates who were afraid. All the people were celebrating on this day. They sang circumcision song as they dance. If an initiate was to be circumcised the name of the father was mentioned so that those who were far should hear it. The close associates  of the initiate are the ones who were celebrating and singing songs. Most of the initiation was done where trees were planted and they formed a small forest and the place was cool.</p>
<p>He had knives that were sharp for the purpose of circumcising the initiates depending on th situation that they had gone through. Long time ago he used to circumcise people after applyin on the blood that was mixed. But because of HIV/AIDS the initiator has to use razor blade that have been approved by the office of Health, and each initiate has to have his own razor blade. There is no sharing. He also use gloves, one pair per initiate. The government of kenya is very strict to the people who are initiating the children, if they do not follow the instructions they can be taken to court. They are also announcing that other initiates can be circumcised from the hospital, because of health regulations and HIV/AIDS has spread all over the world.</p>
<p>INITIATION AND WOMEN</p>
<p>Women are not allowed to move near where initiation is taking place. If they are doing the initiation in the forest, the women are not allowed to enter inside, instead they remain outside the forest and wait from there. They are not allowed to get into the forest. They also don't enter into the houses inside the forest where the intiates stay. They get there strictly under permision, maybe when they are taking food to the initiates. They do not reach there. They shout from a distance then the people looking after the initiates, run to pick the meals. Women who were known to be unfaithful to their husbands were not allowed to move near there. They were to send young girls there. Women were there to sing and motivate the initiates to make them courageous. They are the ones who shouted, when they took food there for the intiates. "Vadili" are the people who look after the intiates. They are the ones who went to take the food whenever the women brought it and shout. They could take the food from them then they serve the initiates and check on how the initiates are doing, and also check if the wound is healing.</p>
<p>THE INITIATES HOUSE</p>
<p> "Itumbi" is the house where the initiates are taken after to stay. The house was constructed at a good place. Sometimes they used to pick on a house that belonged to an old man, or an old woman who was staying alone. Whenever they found the house they used to ask the owner to leave and it becomes a house where the initiates live in. The owner of the house used to leave the house, and if he was an elder person of great virtues, he was asked to take care of the initiates. If such house was not found they used to construct a house for the initiates. The initiates who were initiated during the first 20 initiation periods, they used to stay in the houses for 6 months then they leave the place. </p>
<p>The initiates that belonged to the age-group of Lubwoni and Lloro they stayed for 3 months. Intiates of great group and a small group they stayed in the house for 2 months. This is the place where people learned handcraft work, making baskets, sharpening sticks and making hives. Things that the initiates made were done depending on the availability of the materials. The initiates who were staying in the forest for six months are the ones who had enough time to learn this kind of work. </p>
<p>THE PERSON WHO WAS LOOKING AFTER THE INITIATES</p>
<p>This is a person who was appointed from a village to go and look after the initiates in the forest. This is a person who was known to have good morals in the village. He didn't have any blamish. Whenever the initiates were in the forest, he is the one who used to stay with them and taught them good morals, or what people who are initiated need to know. This is a person who also knew several songs and the occasions where they were applicable. He is the one who taught the initiates these songs and he is the one who was leading as they sang. The house had many initiates even beyond thirty initiates. The people who were looking after the initiates were around three or four or according to the number that the elders of initiation wanted. The name "Mudiri" came from the term "Lidiri" this is the house where the initiates were staying and taken care of. </p>
<p>NAVIHAYA</p>
<p>When the circumcision surgeon was ready to initiate, he showed up that he was ready and had to prepare to start his work. And the initiates were preparing when the initiation was near. Those initiates that were ready to be circumcised they used to stand near the circumcision surgeon. The initiate who stood courageous before him, and ready to be circumcised before others, he was praised and he was called "Navihaya" this title was given to the boy who stood first to be circumcised. He was given the opportunity to eat the food first before other initiates, he was also praised in songs as a hero. That is the reason to why he was given that title. He was watched by the elders as he grew and he did great things in his courage as he grew.</p>
<p>Kukuba Ikigalama</p>
<p>If the initiate was a coward, and tried to pull himself away while he was being circumcised he was hold by the people who were near and then put to sit down. His hands and legs were hold as the circumcision surgeon circumcised him. The initiate who did this was said to be beaten upside down. The term Kigalama is from the word magalama. This initiate was criticized in songs. His parents were ashamed because of their boy.</p>
<p>PAYMENTS FOR THE CIRCUMCISION SURGEON</p>
<p>Since the early initiation of the past years up to the oldest initiataion, the circumcision surgeon was paid a hen, and he is the one who gave the number of hens that he wanted. If the initiate was a coward and he touched the hand of the circumcision surgeon while he was being circumcised, he had to give a goat as a fine. Before circumcision began, the initiate were asked to go and look for some plant for holding on the head when they will be circumcised. When he was being circumcised he could hold it on the head until he was done. The initiate was doing that so that he does not hold the circumcision surgeon's hand while he is circumcised inorder to avoid being given a fine. If the circumcision surgeon took much tme on one initiate, this initiate had to give a goat as a fine. If the circumcision surgeon knew that the father of the initiate had not payed a debt, the initiate was not circumcised until the debt was payed, he started to circumcise a little than he leaves the initiate there until the father pays the debt or gives details on how he will pay the debt. That is when he will return to accomplish circumcision of the initiate. Since the age-group of Imbalambala to the second one, that is when money came in. The circumcision surgeon was paid a hen or money that was enough. </p>
<p>FOOD USED IN THE FOREST</p>
<p>Since the initiation that was known as Engengele moving backwards, the initiates were taking porridge alone, during the first, second or the three months. This porridge was taken from a hive that was separated into two halves. When the porridge was over the initiates were allowed to eat other meals like bananas and other meals that the elders had suggested. The initiates who were titled as heroes are the ones who began to eat, all types of meals. Like eating the baked maize flour at first when they entered the forest. according to the initiation that was done from "Kegendi" to "imbili" the initiates were given meals of different sorts that were there since they entered the forest. </p>
<p>AFTER INITIATION</p>
<p> "Mafwogoye" was the initiation that took place after the normal initiation was done. On the initiation day some of the initiates were arguing not to be circumcised because of some reasons, like the sick or those who have gone for a walk. When the circumcision surgeon was moving around to come and circumcise the initiates whose parents had not payed the debt, he also managed to circumcise these initiates who were arguing, or the ones who were not circumcised at first. This is the after initiation. </p>

<p>The initiates ate together, during their stay in the forest and they cracked jokes, they played and sang together. As they did this they made friendship. This friendship was encouraged when they were leaving the forest. in some cases the parents are the ones who invited the boys who were friends to their homes. This friendship made the parents and the boys who were friends to know if there were behaviours like witch, theft and other things in their homes.</p>
<p>After the friendship as been promoted, each friend had to do something for his friend. On the day of leaving the forest, they could apply on mud. They were applying it on their bodies. They were applying a white mud called Ololongo, on their backs. The other one was called Ikilasi. On the day of visiting one another the two friends were applying the mud on one another. One could take the mud and apply it on the back of the other one, once he has finished the other one could take it and apply it on him too. The friend who began to apply the mud on the other one was the best friend. They were applying the mud to strengthen their friendship. Avilongo is a term that comes from white mud and this mud was called Ololongo. After the initiation the initiates used to visit each other.</p>
<p>One used to prepare food from his home then he invites the other one and he serves him. And the one who has been served used to do the same to the other one, at the right time. These two people used to respect each other, they could not quarrel one another. This friendship was taken care of as a relative and another one. Marriage was not between a sister, cousin or children from the same house.</p>
<p>Liakuka, livina ni liduya midigiru ni lisolola</p>
<p>During the celebration of the initiation people were gathering themselves in groups as they sang and danced. They were using sticks to hit down. The dancing and the singing was rhyming. This was taking place in stages, during the days near initiation and during the initiation period. The maragoli had wealth, and cows. They were keeping the bulls until they become very huge.</p>
<p>These bulls were kept in preparation for any activity or event that was to take place. In wealth these were one of the people with good heart, they were good at giving. They were giving and allowing their cattles to be used for the purpose of any traditional event. When the initiates were near to leave the forest, the people at home started discussing and making plans concerning the bull that will be used for that event. Before the intiates left the forest they were given time to walk around and play.</p>
<p>During such movements that is when one of the elders could reveal to the person who is looking after the initiates about the bull that will be used when the initiates leave the forest. He could then reveal to the initiates. During the period that the initiates were allowed to move around, one of the initiates could go and take grass then he put it on the bull that will be used for the ceremony when they will be leaving the forest. The owner of the bull used appointed and he accepted because he was treated with respect and was also praised. The bull was then slaughtered and used on that ceremony, the elders could perform some ritual then they keep the bull that was to be slaughtered at the middle. They sang initiation songs as they hit their sticks down as they turn and move near the bull.</p>
<p>They were doing this until the bull fall down and dies. This bull died without being slaughtered because they had tied it's mouth and filled in banana leaves. The bull for such ceremony was not slaughtered according to maragoli culture. After the bull had died the people used it's meat. The materials that were removed from it were tied around the initiates.They were tying it around the arms and the neck. They were tying these material with the belief that they will shield the initiates from death, or bad things. And during this ceremony that is when the initiates were given the title of the initiation or the name of the age-group. After this ceremony, the parents of the initiate were asked especially the mother to take the initiate who is now a man around the homes of his relatives, as he was given hens as a reward. This made the initiates to know their relatives and it also made the initiates to have something that he owns or calls his; like the hen or the sheep. The relatives who were near, could prepare baked maize flour and then they call the initiates to share the meals together. The relatives could also visit and give him a goat. When the boy was invited to visit his relative he was going there with his material that he tied on. He also walked along with his friends who were his age-group, that they enjoyed walking together.</p>
<p>That is what I was willing to tell you.</p>
