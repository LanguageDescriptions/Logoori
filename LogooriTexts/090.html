<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Girls who went to look for firewood</p>
<p>Long time ago we had three girls who went to look for firewood. While they walking they talked about their things as children do. They reached the forest and began to look for the firewood. Two of them gathered their firewood together and the other one luckily or unluckily she got a skull. She began to laugh at the skull as she turned it, while the others continued to gather firewood. When they finished they kept their firewood together ready to go home and she realized that she had not gathered any. She was just looking at that skull and now not laughing at it. When the others left she wondered why she was remaining in the bush alone. She left, the others have gone and she is following them behind. When she left the skull also left, she was moving as the skull follows her behind. It began to sing:</p>
<p>Mulele wait for me mulele*2</p>
<p>You are laughing at the skull mulele</p>
<p>Mulele wait for me mulele</p>
<p></p>
<p>When she looks behind she does not see what was singing. She goes ahead and the skull begins to sing:</p>
<p>Mulele wait for me mulele*2</p>
<p>You are laughing at the skull mulele</p>
<p>Mulele wait for me mulele</p>
<p></p>
<p>She went and arrived at home and entered the house. When she got insdie she heard something singing outside:</p>
<p>Mulele wait for me mulele*2</p>
<p>You are laughing at the skull mulele</p>
<p>Mulele wait for me mulele</p>
<p></p>
<p>She asked herself that something that was singing while she was at the bush is the same thing that I singing outside their house. "How did it get here?" she asked. She listened for a while and she heard it singing. What she did is that she tried to hide. Where she went to hide, it was still the same case. She returned to the house. When she got there it began to sing again. She told her brothers that something has followed her from the forest and it is outside but she does not know where the thing is. When they went outside it began to sing:</p>
<p>Mulele wait for me mulele*2</p>
<p>You are laughing at the skull mulele</p>
<p>Mulele wait for me mulele</p>
<p></p>
<p>The boys wondered what to do. She asked them to assist her, the boys took the skull then they went and threw it away. It has ended there.</p>
