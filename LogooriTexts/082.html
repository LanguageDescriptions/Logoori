<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Old man Nyadida</p>
<p>We had an old man called Nyadida. That old man had his children, in the morning Nyadida used to call his children and say "you come we have a meeting we want to share issues" the children used to come. When the children came he used to tell them how they could stay. Then the children say that it was well father. There was a day Nyadida had a child that he loved most. It appeared that Nyadida loved that child more and he didn't want the other children. That child was doing his tasks at home and the other children were plotting to kill him. The father knew that they had grudge with him. Then he began telling them "you are my children, but I am seeing that you do not want the other child and you know he is my lastborn and you are the elders. On that note that you should take the other one as your brother" they didn't want to listen to that. When they started quarreling and piercing the small child the father didn't like that. One day he went with him to a ceremony. When they went to the ceremony the others had plotted to kill him when he returns. And where their father had gone, someone had signaled him that he should be careful, because they were planning to kill their small brother. They were saying that he loves him very much. "Everything that happens he says that he takes over, he does not allow his elder son to work on them" their father told them they have done well to inform him that, and he wont like anyone to kill him even the wife. While they were there a woman came and was singing:</p>
<p>A man that I am singing while at their home</p>
<p>Aaa wooiye haa</p>
<p>This one that I am singing</p>
<p>Aaa wooiye haa I will cry</p>
<p></p>
<p>A man that I am singing the one that cooked for baked maize flour and eggs</p>
<p>The man that I am singing gooo I am telling him</p>
<p>The one that received a child and called him chipanzee</p>
<p>You have seen that person is a grown up</p>
<p>Atsunu wooyi nii wooyi is grown up</p>
<p></p>
<p>The woman finished the song, when the man entered in they began to sing:</p>
<p>A woman that I am singing while at their home</p>
<p>Aaa wooiye haa</p>
<p>This one that I am singing</p>
<p>Aaa wooiye haa I will cry</p>
