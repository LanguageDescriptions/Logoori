<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">When a woman cooked meat</p>
<p>We had a woman and this woman had cooked meat. Then she asked her child to go and prepare baked maize flour. The girl went and prepared baked maize flour. When the woman went to check on the meat, and bring it on the table for the children to eat. She found that it wasn't there. Someone had eaten it. The woman said "eeh, I prepared baked maize flour, for you to eat with meat and I have found you have eaten" when she asked who ate it, all of them denied. What the woman did is that she took a rope near water. The water was so deep, they call that place "lliva" the first girl went to the rope to swing, as she sang saying:</p>
<p>Mother shake the rope I climb woi! I climb*2</p>
<p>The rope didn't shake, </p>
<p>Oh oh! ogre cheated me*2</p>
<p>Another girl went and sat on that rope, and she began to sing:</p>
<p>Mother shake the rope I climb woi! I climb*2</p>
<p>The rope didn't shake, </p>
<p>Oh oh! ogre cheated me*2</p>
<p>The girls sang like that until it was the turn for the last girl, and she began to mumble, words were not coming out of her mouth. They told her "you are not singing well. Sing well the way others have been singing" and the girl began to cry. She cried as she said:</p>
<p>Mother shake the rope I climb woi! I climb*2</p>
<p>The rope didn't shake, </p>
<p>Oh oh! ogre cheated me*2</p>
<p>They told her that she didn't sing like the others, the rope shake and the girl fell inside the water. When she fell inside the water they left her and said, that someone who has eaten the meat is that one. "We have met the thief, when we denied we seemed that we had not stolen the meat" they left her drown in water because she had stolen the meat causing others not eat and stay hungry, while he ate it alone. It teaches us that if a child is a thief you find something to for tracking him/her because he/she has caused others to stay hungry. They have reached there.</p>
