<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">A woman who liked birds</p>
<p>We had one woman who liked birds. One day she left and went outside and found that many birds were there. And she began singing to them like this:</p>
<p>A hungry bird*2</p>
<p>Take a feather</p>
<p>You run away very far</p>
<p>In most cases you will be killed*2</p>
<p></p>
<p>The following day when she went out, she found those birds had come and they were there. She sang to them:</p>
<p>A hungry bird*2</p>
<p>Take a feather</p>
<p>You run away very far</p>
<p>In most cases you will be killed*2</p>
<p></p>
<p>That woman reached to a point and said, "will I live to sing for these birds, this day one of them has to die" she went and trapped that bird and the bird got into the trap and she caught it. When she caught it she went with it to her house and she said that she was going to kill it on that day. Now when she was preparing to kill it when the bird saw that she was preparing to kill it the bird began singing for that woman and it was singing like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Slaughter well*2</p>
<p>Woman slaughter me well</p>
<p>Woman slaughter me well</p>
<p>It is still small*2</p>
<p>It was given then it did it is still*2</p>
<p></p>
<p>That woman was silent then she listened and said, "eh, the bird has sung for me" I will finish slaughtering it. After that she prepared her pot, and she said that she wants to keep it on the fire. When she was keeping it on fire, the bird began to sing:</p>
<p>Cook me well*2</p>
<p>Woman cook me well</p>
<p>Cook me well woman </p>
<p>It is still small*2</p>
<p>It was given then it did it is still*2</p>
<p></p>
<p>The woman wondered with the song and she said, even if it sings on that day, she has to cook and eat it. The woman cooked that bird, she prepared it well, and when she was removing it from the fire, so that she can prepare baked maize flour, the bird sang for her:</p>
<p>Remove me well*2</p>
<p>Woman Remove me well</p>
<p>Remove me well woman </p>
<p>It is still small*2</p>
<p>It was given then it did it is still*2</p>
<p></p>
<p>The woman removed it from fire then she kept it aside then she prepared baked maize flour. She prepared it and removed it from the fire then she kept it aside. She took a plate and began to serve her bird from the pot, while she was serving it, it began to sing to her:</p>
<p>Serve me well*2</p>
<p>Woman serves me well</p>
<p>Serve me well woman </p>
<p>It is still small*2</p>
<p>It was given then it did it is still*2</p>
<p></p>
<p>The woman served and she began eating it. When she had started to eat it the bird began to sing to her:</p>
<p>Eat me well*2</p>
<p>Woman eat me well</p>
<p>Eat me well woman </p>
<p>It is still small*2</p>
<p>It was given then it did it is still*2</p>
<p></p>
<p>The woman began eating her baked maize flour, and she got to a point where she realized that she had overfed. Then she began asking herself "is it the bird that I ate, how does it look like?" the woman was in trouble and she was in the house alone. She began saying, "I have eaten a certain bird, but does it look like the one that people normally eat?" she talked to herself because she didn't have someone who could listen to her. That woman was in that house, having trouble the whole night. In the morning the neighbor came and knocked the door. She asked, "What has happened to the woman who stays in this house?" the woman was still on the floor. The woman was just saying "I am inside but my stomach is not good" she asked her to open the door and when she opened the door, she found her down on the floor, she had peed to herself and she asked her "what is wrong?" and the woman told her "yesterday a bird came here and I trapped it now when I was cooking it the most surprising thing is that the bird was singing to me, when I cook it sang, when I removed it from the fire it sang, when I served it sang now when I finished eating it the stomach was full, then I became sick " the woman told her that it seems like she had eaten a bird that people do not eat. Then she said "it seems like its true" and the neighbor replied "yes it is true" from that time the woman said that even if the birds sing to her a song she will never eat them, it is better to take a normal bird if it is old. She use it when it is old than other birds that she knows. My story has ended there.</p>
