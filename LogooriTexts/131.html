<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Parents who perished 1</p>
<p>My name is Linet Mmbone staying at Jidereri. </p>
<p>I am going to tell you a story about a boy whose parents perished.</p>
<p>Long time ago we had parents of a boy but surprisingly all the parents passed away. The father of this boy was the first one to die leaving his wife with the son. When the father died this woman was so sorrowful because the father was working for the mother daily. This father is the one who knew everything that was taking place at home; this woman was just there. This father is the one who knew everything even farming he used to plant his millet and wheat because the wife was not grasping anything. This woman was stressed about the death of the husband because she didn't know how to look for food. The woman screamed and mourned with her son. She told her son, "My bread winner has passed away what will I do today? I am in problem. Today I have to know how to plant" the neighbors were listening and laughing at her. After mourning the death of the husband she asked her son to step in the place of the father because if he doesn't hunger will kill them and neighbors will laugh at them.</p>
<p>You should know that this woman was lazy. Her work was to walk around and she was not moving anything. Her work was to walk in the village, listening to gossips from people everyday. Her husband used to warn her but she was not taking heed of it. This woman was caught up in that bad situation. People started laughing at this woman because she was dependent on the husband for everything. Even planting. The husband used to prepare his food and stores it but the woman didn't know how to store it in a storage place the way other women do. When the husband died this woman was worried because her actions were not good and the husband often warned her but she wasn't listening. He used to tell her, "Woman you will open your eyes when the spider has come out of the eyes and you will know what you will do in your homestead you yourself and you should know that time will have really gone with the reason that you were a foolish woman"</p>
<p>Because if she would have followed the instructions she could be well even if she has remained at her home if she looks at other women they take care of their homes and maintain discipline well. This woman began remembering a lot of things that the husband used to tell her most of the time but she wasn't taking heed of them. It reached a time she didn't even have tea, if she thinks of doing anything it was difficult because long time ago you could not just walk into someone's compound. They used to say that you would finish the children in that compound. But since the woman was used to walk she got herself into problems. They made her stay home for six month and what she was doing every morning was to mourn about the death of the husband saying that the neighbors had killed her husband forgetting that the husband used to teach her but she was foolish. She refused to follow what the husband was telling her. She used to say that the husband has left her, her breadwinner, the one who was digging for her and she was wondering. That is when she clashed with the neighbors.</p>
