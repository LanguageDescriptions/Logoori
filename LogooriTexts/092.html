<p>Ni yago vutsa, Sande.</p>
<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Two girls</p>
<p>My name is Linet Mmbone and I want to tell you a story about two girls. Two girls: Anakanani and Anakamuna</p>
<p>They were two girls and they loved each other. When they were together they did their work together. Even when they were going to the river they used to got there together. Even when they were going to the forest they used to go there together. And they used to share there issues and how they could go about them together. One day they agreed to go to the forest to look for firewood and they started their journey to the forest.</p>
<p>They all went to the forest and they began to look for the firewood. When Anakanani was looking for firewood, he looked up and saw a fruit on a tree. She was happy and she told her sister that she has found a fruit  but she doesn't know how to reach and pluck the fruit. The sister told her that they look for a stick and clear the way inorder to pluck the fruit. They cleared the way until they got the fruit. And when they got there, they agreed to climb on the tree since everyone has her stomach.</p>
<p>They climbed on the tree and began to pluck the fruit because they were hungry and they began to eat. One of them saw down and she saw an ogre. When she looked down and saw the ogre she said they have met trouble, and she has seen something down. The sister suggested that they start to sing. And one began,</p>
<p>I Anakanani*2</p>
<p>This hunger is the one that caused me to climb on this tree</p>
<p>Anakamuna wondered what to do, because if she go down the ogre will swallow her</p>
<p>She decided to jump to another tree so that when the ogres come they won't find her. Anakanani decided to climb down and the male ogre asked her "who told you to climb on my tree?" she replied that the hunger made her climb the tree. The ogres ran very first because the girls had to cross a river.</p>
<p>When these girls reached at the river, they thought that the ogres had gone, but the ogres had hidden somewhere. The ogre told Anakamuna that she thinks she is so clever, they want to see how clever she is. Anakamuna lacked what to say. The ogre took Anakamuna and threw her in the river because she thought that she was clever. When she crossed the river, she remembered that they were two and how comes that she is going home alone. She thought for a while and it came out clear that she will not go home alone. She heard the voice of the girl that she was with singing. This girl began to sing.</p>
<p>The ogre has caught me</p>
<p>On the tree they have caught me</p>
<p>I have not reached home</p>
<p>On the tree they have caught me</p>
<p>I have not reached home</p>
<p>When these girls left home, they went to the forest to look for food to eat since they had children that needed to be breast fed and so they went to look for food inorder to get energy to breast feed. The ogre released the other girl and they were happy when they met each other again. </p>
<p>When they reached the road they began to laugh as they jumped. Anakamuna began to say they go and kill their children because they didn't see the need of having children. Anakanani tricked Anakamuna to kill her child because Anakanani was clever she did not kill her child. Since Anakamuna was a fool she went and started to do the way they had agreed and she killed her child. My story is teaching us to be clever and not be like Anakanani and Anakamuna who cheated one another.</p>
<p>I want to make my bricks and before I make the bricks I will start by building a house where I will be making the bricks from. I go to the farm and look for a place where I can make the bricks from. We have some type of soil that is not good for making bricks while some are good for making bricks. I have employed some young men who will assist me to dig the soil.</p>
<p>After digging the soil I also have some three women who fetch water. I will mix the soil and water to make it muddy. I will then cover the mud with banana leaves for about three days. After three days am now prepared to make the bricks. I will look for three buckets of water and put them near, together with a wood for shaping the bricks. I will also need a helper.</p>
<p>I will get into the mud as I mix it as I put it on a rectangular wood then I carry my bricks in a careful way and take it where it should be. Then I arrange them there, after aqmking the bricks I will start to turn them. I willk come in the morning and remove the banana leaves. I will turn the bricks and then in the evening at around 3 pm I will carry them to the house. </p>
<p>After I have made my bricks I will think on how to burn them. I will go and look for money and tree that I know will burn the bricks. After that I will look for someone who will help me burn the bricks. He will arrange my bricks according to the number that I want and also the way I want. I will arrange my bricks and then look for water and soil then I make some mud and apply on the outer surface of the bricks that I have arranged.</p>
<p>After I have finished, we shall light fire inside the two holes that we made while we were arranging the bricks. After lighting the fire I will pray and then put in firewood. In the evening I will slaughter a hen. Then we shall eat the baked maize flour and the chicken near the bricks. And on that day I will not go to sleep. I will look after the bricks until morning I will try to reduce the fire when it is 12 noon I will cover the burning bricks then I will return home. After two days I will return to check on my bricks to confirm if they got burnt or they got spoiled. I will do it by removing the outer mud from one side. Then I will have finished making my bricks.</p>
<p>That's all, thank you.</p>
<p></p>
