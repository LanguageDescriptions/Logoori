<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Maragoli lifestyle</p>
<p>My name is Stanley Mugalo, today is March 4, 2014 I have a story about the lifestyle of a Maragooli. A maragooli came from a place called "Imadioli" he came from the Luo land. There were two maragooli from the lake and their cousin was called mugusi. When they arrived at the lake the wind blew and they met on water.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The maragooli walked on feet and arrived at a dry place. He walked on feet from the lake side. And he reached at a side called "Mungoma" which is in vihiga village. When the maragooli arrived at that village he found a girl that he took to stay with as husband and wife. This girl was called Kalyesa. Mulogooli stayed with her the way someone stays with the wife. They got four children, these four children made the sub-tribes of maragooli. The first sub-tribe is called Musali, the second one is Mkitsungu, and the third one is Mmavi and the fourth one Mukirima. The four people are the ones who make the sub-tribe of Maragooli.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you want to find more about these sub-tribes, you will find how they began up to where they are presently. Those are few teachings about the Maragooli. Presently if you go to Vihiga village you will find the house that Maragooli stayed in. </p>
