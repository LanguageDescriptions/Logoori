<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">A barren woman</p>
<p>There was a barren woman. She was not giving birth. She stayed for long without children. She went to a witch to asking what to do so that he could give birth to her own child and be called a mother to someone. She went to someone who gave her herbs. They kept the medicine in a ditch next to a tree. When she went home and spent a night, the following morning she found something inside. She went the next day and found something like a lizard. She went and found something was growing, and it was a child. When she stayed the child grew and asked for porridge. When he wanted porridge, he was hungry and he started to sing:</p>
<p>Go and tell mother at home very fast*2</p>
<p>The child needs porridge very fast</p>
<p>Someone went and told the woman like that. I have passed near a tree I am heard a child singing; he is saying that he wants porridge. The woman cooked porridge and took it there. She stayed and then when the child started crying for things like bananas, potatoes, he began to sing:</p>
<p>Go and tell mother at home very fast*2</p>
<p>The child needs porridge very fast</p>
<p>The woman prepared the banana and she took it to the child, and he ate. When the child grew he didn't go to school. He continued to stay there (in the ditch next to the tree) when the child was at the stage to be circumcised. The he began to sing:</p>
<p>Go and tell mother at home very fast*2</p>
<p>The child needs porridge very fast</p>
<p>Someone went and told the woman like that, they went and look for someone who can initiate him. After circumcision he continued to stay there and they used to take food to him. Then he started to sing:</p>
<p>Go and tell mother at home very fast*2</p>
<p>The child needs porridge very fast</p>
<p>Someone went and told the mother that he has passed there and he has heard someone asking for a wife, now the woman looked for a wife and took her to him. When the wife was taken there, they left the place and they build a house and stayed in. after staying for sometime they gave birth to a child who was a boy. The woman used to go to the forest to bring food for them to eat. Her wife was called Sofia. One day Sofia went to the forest with others, to fetch for firewood, the others came back home, he waited for her but she didn't come back. He looked but he didn't see her. He asked the others where they left Sofia. The child began to cry and he wondered what to do. He took a seat and he went to sit outside near the door. He began to sing like this: </p>
<p>My Sofia made me see the sunshine</p>
<p>My Sofia made me see the moon</p>
<p>My Sofia made me see the sunshine</p>
<p></p>
<p>The woman is missing what shall I do*2</p>
<p></p>
<p>He didn't see Sofia coming to the house, he continued to sing like that and the seat started getting back inside: </p>
<p>My Sofia made me see the sunshine</p>
<p>My Sofia made me see the moon</p>
<p>My Sofia made me see the sunshine</p>
<p></p>
<p>The woman is missing what shall I do*2</p>
<p>He continued to sing and the seat, the child and him went underground and they were never seen. And it end there.</p>
