<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">At the well</p>
<p>My name is Esther Mmbone, old women used to teach us. At first we used to go to the well using pots to carry water. We used to go to the well if you are a girl who has just married to a man. Or she has gone to a new homestead. They used to chase us away saying that we do not fit there. They also taught us how we can make flour from wheat and millet. Bean stew was made after grinding it on the mill. We used to boil it on fire then we add salt. We did not have cooking oil so we added in soda ash. </p>
<p>Old women used to sleep on the banana leaves. They dried and put the banana leaves together and sleep on them. They left the banana leaves and started using sacks. Then after leaving the banana leaves they started using mattress. They used to take their porridge from a gourd. </p>
<p>I want to tell you my story. There was a woman who told her children to remain there; I am going to look for food so that you eat. That woman went and found that the food was not there. Then she said:</p>
<p>Mother went to look for food, and denied Ndyegu</p>
<p>Ndyegu why are you crying</p>
<p>Tsini tsini tsini tsini</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Those who have listened to me may God bless you.</p>
