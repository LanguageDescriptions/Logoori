<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Marriage</p>
<p>My name is Esther Mmbone and I am going to tell you about the lifestyle of the past. When a boy wanted to marry a girl, the boy used to send a woman to go and ask the the girl to marry him. When they went to ask for the girl the parents of the girl used to suggest visiting the home of the boy first. Two women used to go there then they speak with his parents. After speaking with the parents, they could walk around the homestead they used to tell then girl, then the boy used to ask his friend to take him to visit his woman. He could then go to visit the girl then they could agree with the parents. The parents could ask the boy to love their daughter. He could accept and say that they love her. They used to agree then the people could take the girl to the boy's home. </p>
<p>The girl used to be happy and she used to stay with her parents in law. Her parents used to say that if they want their daughter to stay in that homestead, they should give them cows, they used to say that they do not give cows immediately until the girl gives birth to a child that will prove that she is a parent hence will be given the cow. The boy and the girl used to stay together and after receiving the first child, the parents used to be very happy. They could come to congratulate their girl inorder to be given the  cows. They were congratulating their girl with happiness. They used to stay then the boy give the cows as dowry. The parents were very happy. The boys of the past age had more respect.</p>
<p>Marriage</p>
<p>These days marriage, the parents are the ones who influence their sons on the type of women that they want. They say that "this girl is not a wife" and the parents say "yes when you look at her she is not good you should leave her" the boy used to go and hide himself in the banana plantation. After that he used to go and knock on the girl's window then the girl gets out through the window and she goes with the boy. In the morning the parents could ask "where has our child who was here gone?" then they ask and they find out that the boy whom they had refused is the one who came and took her and they went. She didn't leave the home instead she was building on her marriage in that homestead. She used to stay there then the parents agree not to remove her from there; she was to stay in her home. What they were to ask for was the cattle.</p>
<p>The boy used to go there and says that he has come and he accepts that he took her and what they should come for are the cows. The girl used to stay in her home with peace. The girl was willing to take the jembe and goes to dig the farm. The girl used to leave with her child if she was staying in that home. They used to allow there girl to get married to that boy whether they liked her or not. They were not seeing the parents of the boy. They used to keep quiet. These days a boy approaches the girl and tells her that he loves her and the girl says "I have loved you" when he speaks like that the girl follows her on that day and he won't refuse. What he has said is what he follows. He then tells the girl "Let us go, leave the women they have finished their work let us continue with our lives"</p>
<p>She used to go and stays in that home. The parents used to ask where the girl has gone, whether she is lost, they could walk to find her. They could then find her in the homestead where they were directed. They could try to get her back home but the boy used to refuse and say "I have already finished marrying her, you should leave us to continue with our life since you have finished yours" the girl used to stay their for a month and when the parents wanted to visit her, they could go there in a company of other women to congratulate her for the child that she has given birth to.  They could go there with maize flour, maize, millet, chicken and presents to give to that child with a lot of happiness. When they got there they were welcomed with a song:</p>
<p>This is the day of happiness, when I chose the lord Jesus</p>
<p>The heart is full of happiness, when I chose the lord Jesus</p>
<p>Happy day</p>
<p>It is great, when I was born in the saviour</p>
<p></p>
<p>They could pary then they get inside the house and pray also. They could rejoice then after they sat they could now greet each other. After greetings they could stay for a while and food could be brought on the table. After eating the girl that was given presents could come with the child singing and they could give the child the presents that they brought. After keeping the presents they could sing again, then they greet them well and pray then they bring meals on the table.</p>
<p>How people used to go to war in the past</p>
<p>Long time ago people used to go to war with spears and stones. They used to go for war over a long distance, and the parents could ask themselves "will our children come back home safetly" whenever they asked them not to go to war they could say "no we usually go to war and come back" they used to go there, some could come home safe and others could perish and they could ask "where have our children remained?" and they could say "we do not know where they went when they started throwing stones we ran away we do not know where they went" they could get lost and their parents could not see them. They could ask their parents to prepare a service since their children died in the war.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I want to tell you how a girl used to give birth to a child</p>
<p>The girl used to go to her marriage and she could get the first child and she was very happy. She used to buy cloth for the child and he could be happy, even the people of the homestead were happy. The child could have health. They could take care of the child up to the age of four. These days they do not even finish even a year, they finish three months and they get pregnant again. The first child brought happiness and the parents were pleased. And when you got the second child you were very happy, you didn't buy the things that you were using to carry the child in. </p>
<p>These days a girl gives birth to a child, and she can throw the two month child to you. Then the girl get lost and she goes to look for another child.the children of these days do not have behaviours like those of long time ago, they do not follow what the parents are saying. When she is told something she asks them to leave her alone since they have finished their own and they are doing their own things they should leave her alone. They used to take good care of her, but she didn't want.</p>
<p>I am going to tell you a story</p>
<p>There was a woman who was cooked beans and she had children. When she cooked the beans, she began to sing for her children:</p>
<p>A woman cooked beans in a pot</p>
<p>She denied her elder child</p>
<p>The monster came and told her</p>
<p>You have done a big mistake</p>
<p>Dadadadadaa</p>
<p></p>
<p>My story has ended there.</p>
