<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Riddle</p>
<p>We used to have something called riddle. We used to say riddle and someone replies answer.</p>
<p>Turn it and bite</p>
<p>And the other one says "ah ah, you have not gotten it right"</p>
<p>It was when an ant bites you while down it has bitten you</p>
<p>Then we say: a witch on the fence</p>
<p>Then you ask the other to say. If he/she does not say, you ask for the village/place. He/she says Nairobi or Kisumu then you tell him/her that the witch is going to witch the border of a neighbor.</p>
<p>Then you say again riddle: then they reply answer</p>
<p>When will you cook the flour that was in your house? One will try and say soil. No she has not gotten it right, that soil. No she has not gotten then the other one will say ash. Now she is right. That riddle was like that. It has reached there.</p>
