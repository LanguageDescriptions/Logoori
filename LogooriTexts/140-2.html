<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">The way God made the world</p>
<p>The war of Maragoli and Naandi</p>
<p>When the maragoli came to western they established themselves there and they are still there today.some of their enemies that they were fighting with were the Naandi. These Naandi were attacking the maragoli at night and then they run away with their cattle. This made the maragoli to ist down and they had war with the Naandi many times. One of the wars with the Naandi was near a hill called Muhinga. The Naandi attacked the maragoli at night and they killed someone called Nunga. Amulogoli passed by and was surprised and he said that if a Naandi has killed Nunga, he should not kill another one. The maragoli came out of the houses very fast. The Naandi that were hiding on the hill of Muhinga when they saw the maragoli they ran away and the maragoli blocked them. Another war was on the hills of Nametsa and another war the maragoli met with the Naandi at a place called Ilunza. The naandi killed many maragoli at Ilunza in the middle of the night. A maragoli by the name Kilambi climbed on the tree and blew his whistle to alert the Maragoli those were asleep. The maragoli woke up each other and they asked which Naandi. They blocked the naandi in the river of Itsava. Many naandi were killed at that river and the ones that remained ran away to the hill of Gure in Kisa.</p>
<p>Games in the land of maragoli</p>
<p>The games that the maragoli loved to play was shaking and dancing. It is a dance of different type. The maragoli also loved the game of fighting and putting others down. These games were done in the evening. The year 1930 and 1940 there was the game of football was played most. In the year 1930 the cup of football was called Remington it was played between the locations and all the districts in Kenya. In the year 1933 when Amuyunzu was the chief of Maraogoli south, a team from south maragoli defeated all the other teams in Kenya and it received the cup of Remmington. During the final match the team from maragoli defeated a Vicille team from Mombasa. They were playing from Nairobi it was the first season for a team from North Nyanza District to receive the cup of Remmington. North Nyanza districts three Kakamega, Bungoma and Busia are making western province.

<p>The Luhya and the greetings of hands</p>
<p>All luhya are people who love to have peace where they are. When a luhya person was asking about the other one he used to ask if peace was there. Is there peace where we you are coming from? What are they saying? Or what are they doing where you are coming from? And they respond that they are well there is no issue there is peace. The questions that you were asked and then if something had happened he used to say the thing that has happened is this if it is sickness, death or any other thing that is there. This greeting has been reduced to greetings. These greeting is between the two things that unify the luhya people. Since long ago the luhya didn't like to disturb anyone who was a visitor to them. They didn't like to start quarrel with others, they liked staying in peace and this is the reason to why we say the luhya are people of peace but the luhya do not start quarrels and fights for protection and they cannot start war.</p>
