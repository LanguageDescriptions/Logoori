<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">A girl who has given birth while at home</p>
<p>When a girl was staying at home (staying with her parents) then she gives birth to a child she was then called "Kidwadi" she has given birth while a home. In that house, neighbors used to go and check if "kidwadi means the girl who has given birth while at her parents home" has good morals. And the people in that home do not have a bad identity. If boy wanted a wife, the parents used to send some people to the home from which the boy wanted to marry from, to check if them girl has good morals. Then two women go and ask for the girl. They leave very early in the morning then they knock the door and they are welcomed to have a seat. One of the women gives a reason and she says that we are seeing a girl inside here and we want you to give us the girl. And the mother says "yes there is a girl inside here, but you have to take with her in person" then they call the girl and she talks with the visitors who have just entered.  </p>
<p>After speaking with the girl then they say that on certain day, the boy wants to come and see the girl. They schedule a day and the boy comes they see each other and come into agreement. What they used to do is that they used to say we have one cow and calf, and then they bring it. They give it as dowry and the girl is now ready to do a traditional wedding. Then they take other girls, and the girl is accompanied for a wedding. That is the girl who was called "kidwadi" *in other terms kidwadi is girl who is not a virgin.  If the girls who took the bride to the wedding were not given food, they used to leave the place while singing:</p>
<p>I have seen diarrhea where I went*3</p>
<p>I have seen diarrhea</p>
<p>I have seen poverty where I went *3</p>
<p>I have seen poverty</p>
<p>Hunger hunger only*3</p>
<p>Hunger hunger</p>
<p>Now that girl, in the past they used to check the house that she was coming from. It should be a good house that does not have witch. The girl should not be lazy she should be flexible whenever a woman sends her she should go. A child who is quick to listen long time ago they used to check on morals, if the girl is good. Is she coming from a good house and will the person who has taken her stay well together with her.</p>
