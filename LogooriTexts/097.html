<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Politics in Kenya 3</p>
<p>The things of politics in Kenya, Tom Mboya was the one that I was sharing with him and he went to America, he went to visit there, the Americans' came and went with the Europeans. And they agreed to give us the leadership. The Americans' are the ones who had valued and they could assist this land. When I see my people running away from Americans I do not feel good. America is rich over the other tribes. It is also the one that caused us to have the many churches in here and many schools. Even when you see our children going to America when they arrive there they do not come back. They normally say what will they use the land of Kenya for. America has a lot of help/donations without tribal issues. All the tribes in the world are heading to America. I would like the Americans who had that good heart to invite me there I would really love that. They even took me while I was still working here and they wanted me to go and stay there but I didn't go there. The Americans wanted me to go there, but I had a lot of activities here. The Americans are the ones who gave me those activities. I am really appreciating the government of America; they should not have problems with us. They can even invite me there, to spend a month or several days and I will praise the government for that. And our child Obama, people should congratulate him, because he can really assist the world well. When we asked the Americans to come and help us get independence, we took one of their lawyers called Sir Marshall. He was or lawyer, he is the one who assisted us at Lancaster House and turned those words, and the constitution that we had. Americans are the ones who assisted us to have the constitution that has been governing Kenya. Thank you </p>
