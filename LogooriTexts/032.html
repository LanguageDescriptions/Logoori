<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">The ogre with six children</p>
<p>There was an ogre with five children and one child. That ogre began removing chaff from the beans. It removed stones from the beans. After finishing it kept the beans on the fire to cook. It asked his girls to go and weed the maize on the farm. All the girls agreed but one said she was sick and could not manage. The ogre asked her to remain at home and cook the beans. The  girls went to weed the farm together with their father.</p>
<p>The girl cooked the beans when it had cooked, she removed it from the fire and began to eat and finished it. After eating she poured water in the pot and kept it on fire. When the others came home, to eat the beans, they found the pot was full of water. They asked their sister what had happened t the beans. The girl said that she is not sure of what had happened. But it seems like another ogre has come and eaten the beans.</p>
<p>The father asked the girls to follow him. They went near a river. He told her girls that they will cross the river and whoever falls inside will be known that she is the one who ate the beans. They started to cross the river one after the other as they sang this song:</p>
<p>I was not the one who ate the beans, we are going to see my sister in law who is at the river, I your sister in law has arrived the maize is on the other side</p>
<p>The sixth girl came and began to sing and when she had finished singing she crossed the river, when she was crossing she fell inside the river. She said that she had not crossed well and when she tried it again she fell inside the river and died on the spot</p>
