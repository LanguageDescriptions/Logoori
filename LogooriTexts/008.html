<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">To make flour</p>
<p>My name is Linet Mmbone, as the child of Dara Agosa from Sabatia, and I used to here old women were no going to the posho mill. They had their own type of mill that they used. These women used to grind wheat and then they used to prepare bean stew then they eat. Again long time the old women did not have plates for eating, they used what we call "ludelu" they were not seating the way we are seating now. They were seating round on the ground, which they covered with leaves. They sat there and eat. Again grandmother used to tell girls stories. Grandmother used to take girls after eating then she told them stories. And the way they can go to the well and the way they can learn to make flour.</p>
<p>Long time these women used to sleep on the dried banana leaves. Then they left dried banana leaves and started sleeping on the sacks. They did not have clothes. They had a small piece of cover made from skin of a cow that they covered the front part whenever someone comes from the front side. They used to live that life. They used pot to fetch water.  Riddle: did you cook the flour? We cooked ash. Riddle: I have my three friends if one is removed they do not work? Three stones used for cooking. Riddle: I have a friend who stays in a house alone, but the house does not have a door? Egg. Thank you those who have listened to me may God bless you.</p>
