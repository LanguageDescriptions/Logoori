<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Girls in the house</p>
<p>In the house that we were sleeping in as girls, we were six. Three could sleep on one side while the other three sleep on the other side. You could take something called "kachindi" you make it then you put it on the arm. The three are on one side while the other three are on the other side. You take a cow and you now want to let the other three know where the cow is, one of them will touch her arms on the breast, then we stretch our arms. "you have not found the cow, the one who has is another one" we will say that we are drinking milk and we say ssssssip (sip) then we repeat the same.</p>
<p>Now when they want to hit like that you just want to go and touch your arm where the cow is. One group will agree to give the others because they have found their cow. The other group will hit and say we are here, and then you touch and if you are not right they say, "you have not found it" they begin again. They hit and keep in the other one, when you find that cow you now want to drink the milk. We used to do that and some used to defeat others and drink milk ten times and the others if they drunk it for two or three times they have failed. That one was like that. When you reach there that is my cow.</p>
