<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">A woman, a girl and a cowboy</p>
<p>My name is Hellen Makungu and I have a story. And my story goes like this; there was a woman, who had a girl. She also had a worker who was a boy and this boy was looking after the cows while the girl was fetching firewood and taking care of the small baby. One day the girl took other girls and they went to fetch firewood. When they went to look for firewood the boy took the cows out for grazing. While they were looking for firewood, the boy was looking after the cows. They went in separate directions, as they looked for firewood. After that the girls gathered themselves together and one was nowhere to be seen. She had fallen in a pit, others were looking for her but they did not find her. They put their firewood together and went home.</p>
<p>They went and told her parent that they looked for her daughter but they did not find her. They did not know where she went. The woman looked for her but she did not find her. The following day the girls went to look for firewood and the boy took the cows out for grazing. The girls were looking for firewood and the boy was looking after the cow and among the cows there was a bull. The bull reached where the pit was and it started mowing. The girl inside the pit listened and started to sing:</p>
<p>The bull that is mowing, the bull that is mowing</p>
<p>It is mowing like ours</p>
<p>Girls went to look for firewood; the floods prevented her from moving with others</p>
<p>The girls were looking for firewood and they heard someone singing. They came near and the bull was digging down as it mowed. And the girl inside the pit continued singing:</p>
<p>The bull that is mowing, the bull that is mowing</p>
<p>It is mowing like ours</p>
<p>Girls went to look for firewood; the floods prevented her from moving with others</p>
<p>The girls called the boy who was looking after the cows and told him that a girl is singing from the pit and she sounds like the one who got lost. The bull began to mow, as it mow the girl began to sing again:</p>
<p>The bull that is mowing, the bull that is mowing</p>
<p>It is mowing like ours</p>
<p>Girls went to look for firewood; the floods prevented her from moving with others</p>
<p></p>
<p>These children put their firewood together; the boy took the bull home. When they arrived home they went and told the girl's parent, that they reached at a place and they heard a girl singing and she sounded like the one who had lost. The parent asked them if they were sure of what they were speaking. They confirmed to her that they were sure of what they were saying. She asked them to wake up early for them to go and look for her. The woman asked people to look for shovel and they went with the cowboy. They walked and arrived at the place where the bull was mowing, and the bull began to mow, it mowed and the girl began to sing:</p>
<p>The bull that is mowing, the bull that is mowing</p>
<p>It is mowing like ours</p>
<p>Girls went to look for firewood; the floods prevented her from moving with others</p>
<p>The woman said that it was true that she was her girl. The girl began to sing again:</p>
<p>The bull that is mowing, the bull that is mowing</p>
<p>It is mowing like ours</p>
<p>Girls went to look for firewood; the floods prevented her from moving with others</p>
<p>That woman and others took shovel and began to dig down the ground, they got the girl, they took her home happily as they sang. They cooked meals and ate. My story has ended there.</p>
