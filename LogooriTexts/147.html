<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">My history (a)</p>
<p>I will start like this I was born in the year 1930 the august month when it was 1st on a Saturday and I was born in the traditional cultures. I had many problems. I am the seventh born, for the boys we were six and the girl was the seventh one. I was the first born and my parents had problems in giving me a name. The culture says that we call a child the name and I was the first born I was supposed to be called names from where mother came from and they called me many names. The name that made me look well was Lukalu. And the second name I was given was Mulinya; the name of the father to my mother. The names that I was given were Mugoywa, Vihelitsa, Angala, another one was Mmbayi, Mariko, again they added another one Masitsa, Atonya, but when I grew old they called me Herman, and my father is Asava. I have learned from many schools because my father died when I was three years old. I had challenges and among our children there was no one who could stand to educate me and so I was the one looking after them. I went to help them at home and that is when I went to school to read. I learned at Gavudia A-school, Igaiyedi again in A-school, I left Degula, again I went to Jemovo and then I went to Vokoli in the year 1942 I read from there and there was much hunger and left to Butsotso. At Butsotso is where I was and that is where I spent one year the year of 1943 that is when I came back to Vokoli for my education and that is where God gave me my gift. I was a singer, a runner and a footballer; I had good behaviors that the teachers admired from me I was not looking like a student I was behaving like a teacher. The issues of farming were important because I was selling the harvest as I pay for my education even the teacher used to come and look at my farming. I was like a teacher because at lunch time they used to gather around me and I was like a traditionalist a teacher of the bible and the issues of farming they were consulting me. Even at Vokoli I used to stay with many people because I didn't have a person who could take care of the home I used to stay in Lusengeli, I also used to stay in Busali. And one of the clans that I was staying with was vasaniaga or kamunara. I learned more about this clan and I found that they were people who were scientific. Even when you observe people singing songs in maragoli you when you are keen you will realize that they are Vasaniaga. Vasaniaga have a great blessing in this world. I learned a lot of things from the Vasaniaga and I was a good runner and a runner because I was in good terms with the Vasaniaga. I read up to the year 1948 and I finished when I was in class five. Back at my school in Vokoli while I was a student they used to call me British because I knew English very well. Many children were coming to me they wanted to learn English from me.  When I went to Nairobi, I went to sleep at my brother who was called J.Musungu who was at Shell Company. When the white man came he greeted me and he asked who I was and he said that I was his brother. He asked if I had finished school and my brother said that I had finished school and he was looking for work for me and the white man heard me speaking good fluent English and he said that he was going to give me work. He took me to shell company they welcomed me well. The white man announced my name and I was the first African to work at shell. He went and told other white men that they had found one African and had good English with good morals. The white men came to me and asked for greetings and I was speaking good English. They changed my positions greatly from office messenger to store keeper and then office receptionist again as a store keeper. They taught me the issues of the phone and also how to welcome people as a telephone operator. And I was at Shell with the earning of 40 without food or house. I was at shell and I wondered what I could do, how I could get a wife and yet I didn't have a cow. I went to join the work of the Hotel and when I went, I began by washing utensils, sweeping down and cleaning windows. But because of my English the white men admired it and I was not delaying with work. They taught me how to cook food and I began the issues of hotel from there, the white men liked me and I began managing hotels, I was the receptionist, and also managing the issues of the dining room. I went to be taught the things about book keeping and many things the white men were with me and I learned many things about the hotel. Even the work that I went to do the white men used to come and they ask that I go and work for them. I used to go there and I speak and then they say that I was a European. And the fortunate thing is that I didn't know that I will grow while I am here. The white men wanted to take me to United states I do my work form there but I was hard and I refused and said that I wanted to wok from home. I have worked in many hotels here in Kenya. I was the manager in many different hotels even when we went for interviews I used to defeat the white men and I take the work. I have been there and I have worked there for many years. Even when the issues of Mau Mau began I was at Kiambu I was with Kenyatta. I knew Mau Mau while I was still there even Kenyatta while I was still there. I was the one that the white men liked when Kenyatta was being spoke after; I used to get a copy of those minutes. I was the one who gave Kenyatta I showed him the word that they were discussing about him and I gave it to Kenyatta when he was at the parliament while I was representing Western Province. I was with the white men and I knew the culture, politics, our Africans were here like Tom Mboya, Ronald Ngala, Oginga Odinga they asked me to be their advisor. I moved with them all over. Even Kenyatta was with me I was the one who prayed for him when he came to Western province and he was like the first person to start a province here. And I have grown today and given other names because of the things that I was doing here, I have been called by people a slippery stone. This is a stone that you cannot step on. When you step on it you will slide. When you have attacked me and you want to injure me. The second name is Dedan Kimathi. When Dedan Kimathi was arrested I was the one who remained. When they wanted to arrest me I ran and came here and then moved to Lodwar, kapenguria, Maralal, Marsabiti and I ran away. And when I was at Kiambu the Gikuyu called me Muru Waitina; to mean a person of energy. They had respected me. The Meru gave me another one Muthuri wa Mwaki meaning a man who light here. I was lighting my fire that was not blowing off. Another name was Kivolovolo and the name Muru Waitina I was an energetic man and they could not play with me and I also had my farming here and they called me a farmer. I had irrigation and all the farming. I was farming here and the white men were coming here all the schools were coming here and they called me a farmer. And according to the English that I had and the good morals that I had they called me an English man a man who was behaving like a white man. When I was at a place they called me Briton because I was behaving like a white man. And when I went to the things of traditional they called me a cultural traditionalist. I do not want to leave the things of tradition. When I came with the culture I was the one who represented WEKO I was taking food there and they called me WEKO. I was keeping bees and they were calling me honey and I was also treating people with herbs and they called me an herbalist. They appointed me as a counselor and they call me a counselor. When I stood for MP seat they wanted to kill me and they called for me a PC to arrest me so that I do not oppose Mudavadi at all. And we were with Kibisu who was sent to come and kill me. My house was broken in and I was hurt. And back there during the season of Mau Mau, I was among the people arrested at Kodiaga for six months together with Mark Asembo, and Otieno Oyoo. And another person was called Lawrence from Kericho there we were arrested with them. And according to that, I began writing the books about the culture and they named me the writer of traditional books. According to the wisdom that I had they were also calling me professor of the culture. Back then we have now 47 counties when we were at Nairobi in the year 2011, all the seven counties said that they had heard about me and they appointed me as the chairman of heroes of Kenya. Again they were calling me a historian because I have a lot of history even in the history of Kenyatta I am there. And when I am walking here there are many children who are calling me father and others are calling me grandfather because I have taught them many things. The issues about the church they are calling me pastor because I am the pastor at our Friends church. And many people wanted to kill me and when I prayed they used to run away, I have even cut people here five people attacked me, they called me elephant; another person cannot fight me and succeed. Again today about the issues of treating cows they are calling me a vet nary I can treat cows using traditional herbs. Up to today I have done many activities without education and the I am about 85 years but I do not have education, I am moving everywhere, in seminars; Mumias there I was called there to go and teach about the things of tradition, up to Bunyore there, the Nyore love me and even here in Maragoli. I am also at Idako, I am teaching the culture to the vatsotso, vamarama, all of them I have their culture. And even the Gikuyu I have their culture. Even when I came to stay here they were calling a Gikuyu, and not a mulogoli, because of my farming and my behavior I was like a Kikuyu I was not just staying there. And there were many types of food here. I left here when they wanted to kill me and I went to Tanzania, I first went to Mombasa. The Tanzanians liked me especially Nyerere and all the politicians like me. They used to come to my home in the evening and we share stories. I went to work in an airport and the work that I did was the one that I took over from a white man which was food catering and management. I worked there for many years. I stayed in Tanzania for many years and I got blessings. Even this land that I am having is the money that I got from Tanzania, these clothes are from Tanzania, most of my things are from Tanzania, and most of my behaviors are from Tanzania. They elected me and I was in the coalition of TANU and I was the executive there. I love Tanzanian behaviors very much, they do not call someone honorable they call him a brother they are people of respect. Even Nyerere he didn't behave like a president he was opening drinks for people and washing their hands as they eat. And he was an honorable person. Even many people from Uganda are getting work from Tanzania; the Kenyans here are getting work in Tanzania it is a good land I do not know how here in Kenya what we can do to learn the behaviors from Tanzania. They people of value and they do not neglect others, I have worked as a security person together with the police there. The things that you see they have introduced here about the ten houses.</p>
