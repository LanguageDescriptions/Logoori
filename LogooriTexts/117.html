<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">My stay</p>
<p>I am Trufena Mung'ore and I was born from a village I maragooli called Chandumba and I have stayed at maragooli as a girl and I grew and did a wedding as a girl and I was given 8 cows and eight hundred shillings as dowry and I got married. I stayed a good life and I loved my husband whom I stayed with. I am a woman who was born in the year 1936. Before wedding people come and ask for the girl then you accept and you go with the boy. The parents bring letter to the church and they ask you before the church "the letter has come, girl have you accepted?" and you say yes. "you know" and you say yes. They then bring the cows for dowry and you get married. When we were getting married we were taken by some girls and you have gone with your clothes they sing as they take you. They brought me while they were singing a song. During their return back home if they like the husband that you had gotten married to they started singing this song as they go:</p>
<p>Mother will ask</p>
<p>Where have you left the child</p>
<p>Father will ask</p>
<p>Where have you left the child</p>
<p>My friend</p>
<p>Sadness</p>
<p>My friend</p>
<p>Sadness </p>
<p>They have liked it and they walk with the bride</p>
<p>They sang like that then they leave you to stay there</p>
<p>The story that I am saying is this:</p>
<p>Old women of the past used to tell us stories. That woman used to tell us the story of ogres. They said the story after looking for firewood. She said that she was going to make eight pots and the girls were eight. She told them that whoever will break a pot she will give her to the ogres to eat her. One of the girls broke the pot. They took her and the ogres ate her. When the girl was taken to the ogres she hide herself on the sealing in the kitchen. When the ogres came into the house, the girl had some herbs that she threw in the fire and the fire exploded causing the ogres to run away. She sang like this:</p>
<p>Mother brought eight pots</p>
<p>And eight children</p>
<p>She said whoever breaks one</p>
<p>I will take her to the ogre to be eaten</p>
<p>The girl was taken to the ogre, when the ogres came into the house she used to throw the herbs in the fire and when the fire exploded the ogres used to run away. The girl jumped down from the sealing and she went home. They went to look for firewood and one was locked in she hide herself in the ditch because she was afraid that the ogres will eat her. The girl used to hear the cow mowing and then she sings like this:</p>
<p>The bull that is mowing is mowing like the one that was ours</p>
<p>Girls went to look for firewood. The flood prevented them from crossing.The girl used to sing while in the pit and others left her and went to look for firewood. She used to sing like that, they went and removed that girl from the pit, the hair was long and they cut it short and brought her home; it is saying that people who are jealousy they betray others. Like these ones.</p>
<p>THINGS ABOUT CHRISTIANITY</p>
<p>At church we were christians and girls we used to go and sing in the choir. We competed to sing. Whenever we sang, the people who won are the ones who were given the present. We did that to be faithful christians. We used to sing like that even when we became women. We sing on the day when Jesus was born, we follow the word according to the birth of Jesus. That we say on that day. We sing once on the stage. We get prepared both women and girls as we get to the stage to sing. And when we want to sing we have to be people who are confident. We sing a song of the prophets and the angels. </p>
<p>Shepherds were looking after their cattle at night *2</p>
<p>They saw light, great light</p>
<p>They became afraid</p>
<p>An angel appeared to them</p>
<p>They visited the child and the mother and they gave their presents</p>
<p>They saw light, great light</p>
<p>They became afraid</p>
<p>An angel appeared to them</p>
<p>They visited the child and the mother and they gave their presents</p>
<p>They saw light, great light</p>
<p>They became afraid</p>
<p>An angel appeared to them</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
