<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Our children</p>
<p>About life or speaking about our children that we have given birth to if they wont be clever in this times! Because during the colonial period we used to say white man, and today the white man that we have is the father and the mother. Our children are having behaviors that we didn't have initially. Our behaviors were not like that. Our behaviors were where men and women were seating children were not going there, the child was thinking like this that when the father and the mother comes and find that the cow is hungry and the eagle has taken the chick I will be responsible to answer. He was now the watchman in that home, when they come they find that he has grazed the cows, they have taken water, the one that we are milking from has eaten well and it has milk. When the woman will go to milk she milks good milk that we can drink and also ferment. Our children wake up in the morning and they go on the road to the street. When someone comes they run to him and they ask him to give them their share. You wonder the money that he is borrowing did he send you to go and retrieve for him. Our children have refused and they want to stay on the road and borrow. And we have land at home. Even if it is half an acre this child should dig and plant his crops, and he starts to think of what he can do, he can go and take vegetables, he goes and borrow the seeds of kales if he does not have them, he plants the onions and find what he can eat. And if he has gone for alcohol the child leaves the place at night and he comes while shouting and complaining, as he calls people names. These issues are affecting us. I will like the government that we are having especially the children that are in town called street boys. When he has been defeated with what to do he goes to town and pretends to be a street boy and he takes glue and puts it on the mouth and pretends not to know what he is doing and yet he knows it. The government could have taken like for our nation we have land at Maasai Mara, Samburu, North Eastern, Kamba; we have a lot of land that is idle. The government could have taken money from CDF and allocate a certain portion of land and ask for donation. They have forgotten for example British colonized Kenya. America has overtaken us and it is super power, if our government convinces them to give us a loan to build machines, we build a garage and a factory for masonry. They allocate the land and they take all the street boys there. Those children should not go and step at the door they learn mechanics they learn carpentry and farming. When the child leaves there he comes with the certificate that has skills that he can use to sustain him or earn an income. Our children since the government has cautioned people it just waits when one steals and they shoot, when he has stolen someone's shirt maybe someone has worked and bought the shirt, when that child goes to a homes and he sees that there is not one he steal the shirt and runs away with it and people chase after him they catch him and they burn him. I will like the government to consider that thing since we have county government they should as the government to look for the people who are drink alcohol in a bad way, they seek for them something that they can do at least they reduce the behaviors that they are having because someone gives them ten shilling and they run where alcohol is killing people; the beer that is killing people. It is not well our children have problems. We didn't live such a life. It is true there was colonialism and we could not read but we respected elders, we respected women, we feared taking someone's property and running away with it. And that is why God is leading us and we are the way we are; otherwise I have many words about our nations especially African nations the people who are moving around and taking the projects like the ones that we are doing they are really assisting. When they get elder men they know the laws of the culture; teaching good morals. I will like to tell young people who are still young they learn how they can assist themselves and learn how they can work. They will be fine when they go and work for someone they get something small that they can go and use in their home, he sleep well without worrying that he will be beaten, shot or burned. I am finishing by saying that I am John Lubang'a, my father was called Gaidano Lidede. And we always count three names. My name the one that I am speaking is John Lubang'a Lidede I was born at Busali and I will finish by saying thank you Alulu for coming and taking our words and I am ending by saying you bring me a copy of this work I read and see if we did good work or we did which type of work. About the issue of Murang'a there were jiggers and in 1950 the white man saw that the Kikuyu had come close and he had killed white men, the white men brought jiggers and they threw them in Murang'a. The jiggers ate the feet of the Kikuyu in Murang'a and they finished. Those jiggers we wonder if the wind blew them and they spread to the whole of Kenya. Everywhere we had the thing that we call jiggers the colonist was an amazing person. He was wise and he saw if you had sharp eyes that were seeing well he could figure out how he could make then blind so that you do not see well. He didn't want to come and pierce your eyes in open; he wanted to make them blind in another way. The reason to why I am saying this is because chief in the past had eight or ten wives we even have another maasai called Olendutu senior chief he is from maasai mara when you leave Narok and go to Suswa ahead there you pass at chief Olekorieta, you go ahead Molot before you reach Bomet you will find the maasai that we call senior chief Olendutu has twelve wives. I know him even his son was an MP and also Ass. Minister Stephen Olendutu. Where was HIV/AIDS and those men have stayed with their wives for many years. The issue of Aids must have been thrown here so that these people find the market of their medicine. And maybe it is a simple thing that they have hidden and people are dying and they say it is Aids. Or they made Aids to scare these people so that they do not have high birth rate hence defeating them because they have handled the birth already. Even Japan you hear if someone has given birth to two children and he is arrested he should give birth to one child. The issues of jiggers was brought by the colonist and thrown at Murang'a to prevent the Kikuyus from running and asking for leadership. And the Kikuyu struggled and said no and it was not just the Kikuyu even the Embu. When you see someone like Otiende; he was among the ones that were fighting for leadership. Asava the hero he was among those that fought for independence. Same to Ochieng Aneko, Paul Ngei from Kamba they arrested them and took them for detention, Fred Kubai was arrested because of fighting for independence, Fredrick Kaggia. Kenyatta who was the head of Kenya, Kariuki Njiru was arrested, a person called Mbiu Koinange ran away to America, Otiende ran and came to hide here at Mbale, and the family of KAU otherwise Otiende could have been taken for detention. Odede, the father to Pamela was arrested. Our man Kiburu from Lunyerere they arrested him and they killed him, we never saw him; the brother to my grandfather Avega they arrested him and they took him to war where he died and we never saw his grave. The uncle to Mulinya died in the First World War. Our people died there and we never saw them we are so sad. When I am writing these word I am saying that the professor who is writing the book should remember us we are were hurt and we are lame. When they consider us they should pay us and we eat there. They remember us in maragoli we are hearing that they are paying and these things are remaining at the office of the chief and governors; we wonder, anyway I do not know. Thank you.</p>
