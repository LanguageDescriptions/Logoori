<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">A woman with calabash</p>
<p>That woman had children. She went and took calabash and went to cook them. When she cooked the calabash, they were not good. They were spoiled. She took the calabash and after cooking her children ate them and they died. When they died the woman used to mourn as she says:</p>
<p>Calabash that I left*2</p>
<p>Have finished my children totally</p>
<p>Calabash that I left*2</p>
<p>Have finished my children totally</p>
<p>And when she brought the calabash, she thought it was good meal that she prepares for her children to eat. She didn't know that it was something that can kill her children. So the children ate and they died. It was a short story like that.</p>
