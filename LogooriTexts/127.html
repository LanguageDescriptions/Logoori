<p>Andrea yavambwa ku musalaba na yilwatsila vandu na aveye kuduka na yamanya akutsi, Tomasi yatumitwa ni ritimu mmbili himbe Malepa mu kivala cha Ivugwi wa Egebeti. Yuda yisunga mwene kuli kulitsama Yesu. Simoni mukaanani yavambwa mu Persia. Matia kutanga yalaswa na magina inyima na kulwa na akalwa mutwi. Petero yavambwa matungama muVarumi. Paul yakalwa mutwi murumi. Livola lia Paolo na akikili kukutsa (2 Timateo 4:6-3) Kiheri cha Tedayo si kimanyikani vulahi mba. Liavukana mu limenya liu munyumba agukutanga. Mu litanga nyasaye yalomba Adamu na Awa yavalanga vamenye halala musatsa nu mukali. Madiku gano liavukana ni linyinge muno mu limenya lia musatsa nu mukali kololanga mu vina likubana linyinge ni litana. Vivune viveye ho vinyinge navutswa vilala ku vio ni yivi: lidaka amegitsu ni vagikiri kuhilana, liavukana lie mima mu tsihiri, liavukana lia mihiga jie lihilana, liyinzila lilahi kutula ku undi, livula konyola avana, linyola avana va lugano lulala, livunanyia amalago ga ihiri nu gu vukristayo, viashara vikora valala kwivilila vulindi vwe tsinyumba na avana vavo, ligehela mu musingi gwu vukristayo, lidaka miyinzi jia koleta vindu viu kutumikila, uvudaka, litovola valina vatadukani, amavatava ga undi mu liva lie limenya, uvugata halala nu vuchafu, vwimani anoho uvuhani ku vageni, liavukana mu limenya, vugeli ni linyola liu undi livula konyola vokonyi kutula ku vandi kijila vudinyu. Livula kuhanilana heshima kijila lihambika, kwigalila vudinyu kuli yivu, uhane tsinganagani ku tsio. Likola lia vakristayo kijila liavukana mu tsinyumba, avasoleli vahevwe amegitsu ni vagikili kuhilana. Mu kitabu cha Koheretso 12:1 mima jia ihri jilondwe ni ganyalika vamenye halala mu lihulitsana. Si vali vosi avanyala konyola avana, kusanditse nyasaye ku vihanwa via avana vu lugano lwosi (Koheretso 11:5, Vathesalonike 5:18) Kwumbake vukristayo vudukilu nu kudinyia ku malago ga ihiri. Kuganagane avana ni tsinyumba tsyitu inyinga ye likola viasara ni miyinzi jinde. Kwavukane na valina vatadukani (Tsingano 22:24-25, Matayo 5:29-30) Kove avaguru mu litumikila miviri jyitu; koleta vindu via kutumikila, kwikutsili ku gosi gatsanga imbili witu mu limenya lyitu (2 Petero 1:5-6; Yakobo 1:45; Vakorinzo 3:13). Koleminyane mioyo inyinga yu vuminiku, kove avaguru kandi avaminifu kijila uvugata voveye vudaka. Kusanyie linyola na kuvuli kwegomba vindu viu vuguli vudinyu (1 Timateo 2:9-10). Kolombe tsikamati kokonya vudinyu mu tsinyumba tsia vache vitu, kulinde vulahi miandu jia nyasaye yakuha kononere. Uvuhambichi vugotitsa, vandu nu koleta liavukana (Tsingano 20:1) Koletane na kokonyana mu ligelihitsana mu limenya lilahi (Vakolosai 3:16) kolombe masanga go koleta linyola mu madala. Kusanditse nyasaye mu liva lia koveye mu (Vafilipi 3:16). Kohenze nu kwingila ku yavo ava imbili; vali ni limenya lilahi. Kusale katsotso, kulie imesa ndala. Inze mbeye mukuyu gwa yesu kristo (Mariko 11:12-14) Yesu yali ni inzala na vigitsi veve kijila logendo ni miyinzi kutsila valola mukuyu vayanza ni vasuvilanga valanyola makuyu gu kulia kijila gwaloleka ni munifu kandi mulahi navutswa gwali mwere vujila makuyu. Yesu yagugaya kwama makuyu. Madiku gosi na gwaniala. Inze mbeye musanji mu livugana mu lidala liange ndasimikwa mu lidala liange. Ndolekanga munifu, nzivika vulahi, nyola chukulia vulahi, mbeye mu mulimi ni mitugu, ngolanga miyinzi jia vwigitsi ni viasara. Valala mu lidala liange vaveye ni midoga ni liva lilahi; yaga gaveye amalahi ku inze kijila ndoleka mulamu kandi we tsingulu. Yesu kristo ahenzanga ku inze nu kusuvila alanyola ku inze amakuyu kulia kutulana ku liloleka liange. Navutswa aganyola ku mba. Avatumwa va yesu vaganaganyianga kijira ligendagenda nu kuhonga ni inzala, kutumika ku livugana nivo vaveye mu vogono vwa yesu. Vindu via koveye navyo viosi viveye makuyu ga yesu yenyanga. Yaga galondekana mu livugana liange na inze mu, liganisa liange lisambuka na inze ho, liganisa lyitu liadaka tsindeve na inze ho, liganisa lyitu liadaka miliango na inze ho; mutumwa wa yesu kristo na aduchi si mwingilitsanga mba, si mbugililanga ikamati yi livugana ekolelwe hango hango mba, si mbananga mudoga gwange gokonye ku tsingendo tsie livugana mba, si nyingilitsanga vageni ni livugana hango hange mba, na anoho lwa vaduchi mulwaye aveye mu lidala wenya atsie mu sivitali na inze ho, vuchafu vwakila muganisa na inze ho, mbeye wa garaha mu lihana vihanwa ku livugana. Gadukila mukuyu gwa kristo gwame amakuyu nimenya mu ye alambalulila ndase kwama (Yohana 15:1-17). Si galoleka inze kololeka munifu vujila amakuyu mba. Viuma viu vulwani vwitu (2 Vakorinzo 10:4-7). Gadukila vwirwatsi vakristayo kolomba amasasi gu kulasa musigu setani uveye mu muviri gwu mundu kijila lienya lyitu no kolomba mundu wa nyasaye ave mudukilu  (2 Timateo 3:17) Vulwani vwitu si vuveye ku inyama na masaye (Waefeso 6:12) kutange kuva avadukilu mu mima avene, lihenza, ligenda, limoloma (2 Vakorinzo 10:6; 1 Petero 2:12) Kumanya tsimbaso tsindagatifu vulahi (2 Timateo 3:16; Matayo4:4). Makuva manyinge gu mwilwatsi gaveye mu lisala, livola makuva madagatifu, lilomba vulima nu musigu, ling'oda ibarwa, lihana vihanwa, lilolana nu kukuba tsimbaka tsindahi. Kumugenihitse mu viselo, nu mu masavo gandi. Vavili, vavaga anoho vanne vasangili musigu mulala (Waefeso 6:11-18) Musikari mulahi wa yesu kristo aveye nu vuguru, ni lisuvila, nu vuluvilili, ni limenya, ni lilinda, liekutsila, litsia, litia nyasaye, ni liyanza avandi nu vusangali (2 Petero 1:5-11). Lisuvilitswa lietu avana va nyasaye (2 Vakorinzo 7:1) Vakristayo vasuvilanga mu lisimuguka lie liva mwoyo lie mihiga ni mihiga (2 Yohana 25:26; Varumi 3:11). Vakristayo vasuvilanga yesu kristo amenyanga navo tsinyinga tsiosi (Yohana 14:23) vakristo vasuvilanga vaveye avana va dada wavo wu mwigulu (2 Corinthians 6:16-18) vasuvilanga yesu kristo yakutsa ma na asimiguka (Vikolwa 2:22-24, 31:32) Vasuvilanga yesu kristo nu mwana wa nysaye, suvila vaveye valolekitsi va yesu kristo, suvilanga nyasaye ahananga liva mwoyo ni vindu viosi, ni vuhindili (Vikolwa 17:24-28) suvilanga nyasaye mulala aveye hosi, mu viosi, wa viosi ku viosi (Waefeso 4:6) Suvilanga nyasaye amanya alola viosi kandi ahulila viosi via kokolanga (Yohana 1:17-18) Kandi suvilanga yesu kristo alatsa kandi (Vikolwa 1:11) Vasuvilanga kololana na nyasaye moni na moni (1 Vakorinzo 13:12; Amos 4:12) Vudamanu vwu muviri nu vu mwoyo (2 Vakorinzo 7:1) Kijira kusuvilanga koveye avana va nyasaye, kwelombe kutula ku vadamanu vosi vwu muviri, nu ku mwoyo, nu kuvudamanu vwu muviri (Vagalatia 5:16-21) Kivihiri kusigamila musambwa, uvukumu, vuheyi, lihingana, amahangari, liavukana, vuhambichi, kwigingilila, uvugata, tsisoni, vulala ku vudamanu vwu mwoyo (Waefeso 4:31) Vutima, lidunya, likendeka, lisuhana, embodoka, vusigu, lichayana, likayilwa litali lilahi. Vutingu, vuvehi, vugadi. Kuvike vindu yivi ihale ku kwinye (Vakolosai 3:3; 2 Vakorinzo 7:11). Vindu kuli yivi viononyianga vutagatifu vwi miviri jyitu, litanga liu vwoni vwosi ni kukalagilwa ma kukutana na roho. Roho akolanga likayilwa lia muviri ma agehelwa tsinguru, tsinganagani tsyitu tsindahi anoho tsindamanu tsing'odangwa vuli inyinga ku vibaho vie mioyo jyitu. Kulakola ki kudukitse vutagatifu mu vuti vwa nyasaye. Lidukitsa vatagatifu mu vuti vwa nyasaye, kwenye kuva avatagatifu kuli dada witu wu mwigulu aveye mutagatifu. Vutagatifu vutangilanga mu mwoyo, vindu vidamanu viosi ni vimali kutula mu mioyo jyitu, roho wa nyasaye yingilanga mu ili ni inyinga yu vutagatifu vwa onyolanga vwiyangu, ilikola lia mundu, onyolanga roho (Vagalatia 5:22-24) Vuyanzi, vusangali, mirembe, vwikutsili, tsimbavasi, vulungi, vusuvilifu, vuhocha nu vwiledi, likola lia yesu kijila mundu wo lugano yilu (Matayo 3:10) vavereranga avandi vaveye muhoma, aveye ni inzala nu vuruhu vwu vulungi, aveye ni tsimbavasi, aveye nu mwoyo mulahi, aveye muhombeletsi, uyu alakalole vulahi vwa nyasaye (Matayo 12:50; Varumi 14:16-18). Litia malago ga nyasaye. Kosome kitabu kitagatifu katsotso, kusale tsinyinga tsiosi, kuvugane mu mavugano, nu kutumikila makuva gege, kukubi tsimbaka tsindahi na vandi, kumwitsominye ni tsinyimbu, litegekela tsingulu tsia nyasaye (Vikolwa 1:8) Kivune mwinye mulanyola tsingulu lwa roho mutagatifu alitsa ku mwinye. Mula va avalolekitsi vange mu Yerusalemi, mu Yuda mwosi kandi mu Samaria, kandi kuduka mu kiheri che lilova. Nyasaye ni roho aveye ni tsinguru kuduka kwetegeke konyola tsingulu yitsi (Amos 4:12) Vakristayo vali mu lietegeka kutula 1902 kuduka 1925 mu lietegeka avamisheni vali halala navo. Vanihitsa miviri, vivika vulahi kutsia imbili we livugana, vasamihana nu kolekelana, vinalitsa kwiga amakuva matagatifu, valeke kwikivuka inyuma gali ga kale, vakonyane ku vudinyu avene na avene, vasale katsotso mugorova na mugamba, valete avandi mu vusanji, madara go kotegeka avasanji gamedeke, vaguluhe mu vutumwa vwa nyasaye, vatevitsa vindu viakolangwa, valeke kwisuha ku ligulu na vakutsu, vavoola ge ligali, valeke vilamo ni vicheno, ma mu 1926 tsinguru tsana tsiatsa ku vo natsio tsiali tsia roho mutagatifu ni kukikiri ku chetegekera.

Yesu yali namali kusuvilitsa avegitsi alavasavila dada mukonyi undi naye ni roho (Yohana 14:16-18) Yesu kristo yali roho mutagatifu lwa yamenya halala na vegitsi veve (Yohana 14:17) Roho ni kindu kitaveye ni inyama na masaye, tsinguru tsia roho tsirorekanga mu vikolwa henza likuyu lia roho mu Vagalatia 8:22, uvuluvilili, engoro, limanya liahana uvuguru, vwikutsili, lilinda, uvuyanzi, litia nyasaye, vuhani (2 Petero 3:9; Vikolwa 10:1-2) Vegitsi vanyola tsingulu yitsi kijila yesu yali namali kuvetegekitsa tsisia kuva ni imbutsa enene yu muhumu (Vikolwa 2:1-4) Roho wa nyasaye si yanyala kwingila mu mioyo jiyaveye minifu mba (Vikolwa 2:38) Gaveye kuli isongo na matsi mu kidaho kwogitsa mioyo jyitu na rho mtagatifu alingila mu (Likunula 22:14) Roho yigitsanga nu kokonya vaveye nayo, kwitsulitsa amakuva gosi (Yohana 14:26) Roho mtagatifu akonyanga vandu kokola miyinzi minene (Yohana 14:12) Kogenda ni tsinguru tsia roho (Vagalatia 5:25) Paolo yakola miyinzi minene kijila yimililwa na roho matagatigu kuli kunyala kuva valolekitsi va yesu kristo (Vikolwa 1:8) yesu yenya vigitsi veve valolekitse miyinzi jia akola halala ni lisimuguka lilye. Ga kudukilanga vosi vasuvila yesu kristo vave avalolekitsi veve. Soma livola lia Petero kijila lilolekitsa lia avigitsi mu Vikolwa 2:22-24, 29:36. Yesu yaguta likutsa, yasimuguka, muviri gwigwe si gwagunda mba. Yanenehitswa kuduka ku mukono murungi gwa nyasaye, Yesu aveye mwami kandi aveye kristo. Komololekitsa hayi, kovolele mundu sia mulala kuli Filipo yakola (Vikolwa 8:9-13, 26-39). Kololekitse yesu ku viduma (Vikolwa 8:4-8) Kololekitse yesu mu vuyanzi vwitu, kololekitse yesu mu vulimi vwitu, kololekitse yesu mu viasara vyitu, mu tsingendo tsyitu, mu vugeni vwitu (Zaburi 137:1-6), mu masanga nu vuhambani vundi.

<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Christianity 3</p>
<p>I am Mr. Benjamin Egadwa Okodi and today is 7/4/2014. I want to tell you the things about the kingdom and connection with God. Andrea was crucified on the cross and he preached to people until when he died. Thomas was pieced with the spear at the eastern side of Egypt. Judah hanged himself after betraying Jesus. Simon a Canaanite was crucified in Persia. Mathew was stoned and chopped off the head. Peter was crucified as it is in Romans. Paul was chopped off the head. The saying of Paul before dying (2 Timothy 4:6-3) the death of Bartholomew is not well known. The difference in the life of a house in the beginning God made the Adam and Eve to stay together as husband and wife. These days there is a lot of difference in the life of a husband and a wife. We are seeing a lot of fight and killings. There are many reasons but one of them is this; lack of teaching and Greeks marrying. Difference in cultures of tribes the difference in the age of marriage, good work from the other one, bareness, getting children of one gender, breaking the laws of the tribe and of Christian. Business is causing some to forget the care of their house and children, being low in the Christian foundation, lack of ways of achieving the bread for the family, poverty, selecting friends that are not good, the problems of the others in life, poverty together with dirtiness, mean or selfishness to the visitors, the wisdom and the achievements without getting help from others. Lack of respect because of alcohol and in order to prevent such trouble you should give your views. The actions of Christians on the issue of division in the house and the unmarried people should be given advice before they marry. In the book of Corinthians 12:1 the cultural laws should be followed if possible they stay together in understanding. Not everyone can have a baby. We should thank God for the gift of all sorts of children. Corinthians 11:5 and Thessalonians 5:18 we build on Christianity and we stand strong on the laws of the culture. We should think about the children and our houses during the time of business and other activities. We should separate from friends that are not worthy. Proverbs 22:24-25, Mathew 5:29-30 we are quick to responding to our bodies. We bring things for consumption. We should be patient in all that comes ahead of us in our lives. 2 Peter 1:5:6, Job 1:45, Corinthians 3:13 we should encourage one another in times of trouble. We should be hardworking and trustworthy because laziness brings poverty. We work to achieve and we should not admire expensive things. 1 Timothy 2:9-10 we should form committees to solve problems in the house of our people. We should take care of the wealth that God has given us and utilize them well.  </p>
<p>Alcohol makes people to loose their way and brings division (Proverbs 20:1) we should marry and teach each other well Colossians 3:16 we should form groups of development in the village. We should thank God in the way that we are. Philippians 3:16 we should loo and learn from those that are ahead and have good life. We should pray always and eat from one table. I am the vine of Jesus Mathew 11:12-14 Jesus was hungry together with his disciples after the long journey and they saw a vine and they were happy because they thought that they will get a fruit to eat because it appeared to be clean with a fruit but it was empty. Jesus rebuked it from producing fruits all the days and it withered. I am a member in my church and village and I am rooted in my village. I am clean, I am dressing well, I am getting the food well, I have a farm with cattle, I am doing the activities of teaching and business. Some people from my village have vehicles and good life. This is good to me because I look healthy and strong. Jesus is looking at me with expectations that he will get the fruit to eat from my appearance. But he does not find them. The servants of God are thinking about walking and staying hungry. To use the church and they are in the presence of God. All we have are the fruits that Jesus wants.</p>
<p>It seen in my church while I am there, my church perishes with me. Our church is lacking seats while am there; it is lacking doors while am there. When the servant of God arrives I do not welcome him. I do not allow the church meeting to be held from my home. I don't give my vehicle to assist in the church activities. I do not welcome visitors from the church to my home or a sick person in the village and needs to go to the hospital while I am there. There is a lot of dirtiness in the church while I am there and slow in giving gifts to the church. The fig of Christ should ripe when I am in him I should grow John 15:1-7 I do not look clean without fruits the shield of our war. 2 Corinthians 10:4-7 we Christians should make the bullets for shooting the enemy who is the devil in our bodies because of our desire to building the man of God to be mature. 2 Timothy 3:17 our fight is not in flesh with blood Ephesians 6:12 we should be mature in behaviors, our eyes, walking and talking. 2 Corinthians 10:6, 1 Peter 2:12 we should know holy verses well 2Timothy 3:16, Mathew 4:4 a lot of things for the preacher are in the prayer, speaking holy words making friendship with the enemy, writing letters, giving gifts. Visiting each other, making good jokes.</p>
<p>Welcoming people in weddings and other meetings. Two, three or four to unite an enemy Ephesians 6:11-18 a good ambassador of Christ is flexible and a believer with courage in life and caring, patient, moving, fearing God and loving others with happiness 2 Peter 1:5-11 our faith as the children of God 2 Corinthians 7:1christians believe in the rising and eternity 2 John 25:26, Romans 3:11 Christians who believe that Jesus Christ is with them forever, (John 14:23) Christians that believe that they are the children of their heavenly father. 2 Corinthians 6:16-18 those that believe Jesus died and rose from the death. Acts 2:22-24, 31:32 those that believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God I believe that they are the followers of Jesus. I believe that God give life and everything and growth. Acts 17:24-28 I believe that one God is everywhere.</p>
<p>In all for all Ephesians 4:6 I believe God sees everything and hears all the things that we are doing. John 1:17-18 I also believe that Jesus Christ will come again. Acts 1:11 for those that believe to see God eye by eye. 1Corinthians 13:12, Amos 4:12 the bad thing about the body and the heart 2Corinthians 7:1 because I believe that we are the children of God we should keep ourselves free from the bad things of the body and the heart. Galatians 5:16-21 we should cease from bowing to idols, adultery, rudeness, arguments, separation, alcoholism, pride, laziness, shyness, others having wrong motives. Ephesians 4:31 anger, frowning, suing, jealous, enemy, criticism, lies we should keep these things far of from us. Colossians 3:3, 2 Corinthians 7:11 things like these are destroying the holiness of our bodies. The beginning of all the sin is to be judged and meet with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is defeated by the strength of the flesh then looses power. Our good motives or bad are written every time on the boards on our hearts.</p>
<p>What can we do to fulfill holiness in fear of God? Fulfilling holiness in the fear of God whether we want to be holy the way our heavenly father is. The holiness begins with the heart when every bad thing has left our heart. The Holy Spirit gets in when holiness gets a chance in. you receive the Holy Spirit. Galatians 5:22-24 happiness, joy, peace, patience, mercy, truth, the action of Jesus because of this person Mathew 3:10 they have mercy for those that are in trouble, he has hunger and thirst for reality, he has mercies, he has good heart, he is comforting he the one who will see the goodness of God. Mathew 12:50, Romans, 14:16-18 fearing the laws of God. We should read the holy book always. We should pray always we should meet in churches and using his words. We should make good jokes with others. We should praise him with songs, preparation for the power of God. Acts 1:8 the reason that you are seeing power when the Holy Spirit comes to you.</p>
<p>You see my followers in Jerusalem, Judah and Samaria and even in the destruction of the world. God is the one that has power and we should prepare to receive this power. Amos 4:12 Christians were in preparation since 1902 up to 1925 in the preparations the missionaries were together with them. They cleaned their bodies and put on well to go and stand before the church. They forgave each other and learnt the holy word. They should leave the issue of turning back to the past. They should assist each other in trouble. They should pray often day and night. They should bring others to fellowship. The homes for gathering believers should increase. They should be willing to the call of Christ. They should ask for the things that were happening. They should leave swearing on the dead. They speak the truth and leave cursing. In 1926 the power came to them and it was a Holy Ghost power. Act 1:8 Jesus is the one who spoke these words after 40 days when he arose from the dead to his disciples on the hill in Jerusalem. Jesus had finished promising his disciples that he will send them Holy Spirit. John 14:16-18 Jesus Christ was Holy Spirit when he was with his disciples. John 14:17 spirit is something that doesn't have flesh and blood. It power is seen through the actions. Look at Galatians 8:22 it shows giving, hard work, patience, care, happiness, fearing God and Giving. 2 Peter 3:9, Acts 10:1-2</p>
<p>The disciples got these powers because Jesus had prepared them and there was a heavy wind with sound. Acts 2:1-4 the Holy Spirit cannot enter into hearts that are not clean. Acts 2:38 it is like pot and water in the river, when we clean our hearts the Holy Spirit will enter in. Revelation 22:14 Holy Spirit teaches and helps those that are with him. We remember all things John 14:12 we walk by spirit strength. Galatians 5:25 Paul did great work because he had Holy Spirit the way we can be good ambassadors of Jesus Christ. Acts 1:8 Jesus Christ wants his disciples to show his work and him raising from the dead. We believe that those who believe in Jesus Christ should be his ambassadors. I am reading the words of Peter because of the vision to his disciples in Acts 2:22-24, 29:36 Jesus defeated the death. He rose and his body didn't rot. He has been lifted to right hand side of God. Jesus is lord and Christ. We should tell one another the way Philip did. Acts 8:9-13, 26-39 we should show Jesus in groups. Acts 8:4-8 we should show Christ in our happiness.</p>
<p>We should show Jesus in our friendship, we should show Jesus in our business, our journey, our invitation. Psalms 137:1-6 in groups and other unions. We should show Jesus in other servant hood. Ways in which we show Christ: prayer, writing letters, telling people about the word of God, preaching near and far, invitations, going to stay with them, giving gifts to others, our lives and actions should be an example to others. The calling of Nathaniel, John 1:43-51the life of Nathaniel. Nathaniel was from the land of Galilee and he was staying in a village called Bethsaida. Where there lived other people like Andrea, Simon Peter and Philip. All of them knew each other. The first ones to receive the calling of Christ from this village were Andrew and his brother Simon Peter. Jesus called them and he told them, "come I will make you fishers of others" when Jesus entered Bethsaida Philip called him to make him and he accepted. John 1:43 and Philip found Nathaniel and told him, "Nathaniel we have found you this is Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph" John 1:45 Philip told him come and see. John 1:46 the actions of Philip; when he received Jesus he didn't keep quiet from telling others about it. He took Nathaniel to Jesus. Jesus told Nathaniel before being called by Philip that he has fulfilled the first mission. What they do was to bring Jesus to the church for the Greeks to know Jesus Christ. We should be prepared because Jesus sees all of us where we are. If we believe in him we will see great things above all that we are seeing because of the opening to us. Our baptism should bring others to the fellowship. Colossians 2:7 Paul is the one who sent this to the church of Colossians who were holy and believers in God. Colossians 1:2, 2:5 Paul was sent to the Colossians in the calling. I believe where I have reached I have reached the end thank you. God wants us to be saved; we should not go to sins. We should be trustworthy to god for him to lead us in days of our lives we continue to live. I have said thank you and be blessed. </p>
