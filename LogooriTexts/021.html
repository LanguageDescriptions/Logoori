<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">A woman with ogres</p>
<p>My name is Maiden and I want to give a story about woman with ogres. We had a woman with children. In that place, there were many ogres. Whenever you wanted to travel and pass via their route the ogres could eat you. You had to figure out how you can pass through those ogres. We had a woman who wanted to go for a journey. She remembered that there were many ogres on the route that she wanted to go through. She wondered how she could pass through all those ogres. And reach safely.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She thought and asked her neighbors how they normally pass through the ogres. It came out clearly that they do not go for journeys. They stay at home. The woman said no and thought of ways to enable her make her journey successfully. She thought the night before the trip and in the morning she said no. I must go to where I want. She slaughtered a rabbit and made a small drum. She knew when she plays the small drum; the ogres will run away and hide into the bush. Then I pass and arrive safely where I am heading. She lit fire and dried the small drum, she played it and the sound was clear.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She played again and it was clear. She bathed and dressed herself, and began the journey. She planned how she will be walking as she plays the small drum and sing. When she arrived where the ogres were, she began to play it as she sing:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is my small drum x2</p>
<p>That I play for all the ogres, so that they can see me</p>
<p></p>
<p>She passed the first ogre and went ahead and found another ogre. That was not running away, it stood and asked her where she was going. She answered that she was going for a journey, and what are you carrying, a small drum. She asked her to play it as she sang:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is my small drum x2</p>
<p>That I play for all the ogres, so that they can see me</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ogre asked her to play it again she played as she sang:</p>
<p>This is my small drum x2</p>
<p>That I play for all the ogres, so that they can see me</p>
<p></p>
<p>She passed the ogre and found another one that asked her the same question. Again she did the same, she met the last one that asked her the same question. Again she played the small drum as she sang:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is my small drum x2</p>
<p>That I play for all the ogres, so that they can see me</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is my small drum x2</p>
<p>That I play for all the ogres, so that they can see me</p>
<p>She met the dangerous ogre, while she was near where she was going. There was nothing that was scaring it. She met that ogre, the ogre asked her what she was carrying this woman began to sing:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is my small drum x2</p>
<p>That I play for all the ogres, so that they can see me</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ogre asked her to continue. She sang:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is my small drum x2</p>
<p>That I play for all the ogres, so that they can see me</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ogre began dancing to the music, it danced until it forgot and the woman passed very fast and arrived safely where she was going. My story ends there</p>
