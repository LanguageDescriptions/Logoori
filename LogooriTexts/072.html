<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">When a girl wanted to get married</p>
<p>Now they will get married and stay. Maybe the girl may want to get married and the people have hard heart. Someone can border a vehicle and go to Mbale because he knows that the child of someone has been married in Mbale. He/she will go there and speak lies or bad things against that couple. She gets there and speaks everything about the home of the girl. The way things are happening there. If those people are easily convinced they normally send the girl away. But if they do not want to follow lies they forget about the things and they say they will wait to hear it from someone else.</p>
<p>That is how people used to marry long time ago, but these days people do not ask where the girl is coming from, her tribe they get married even the relatives. And if a boy or a girl got married to a relative when the girl came to that homestead they have married. They get to there and the woman asks "you girl where are you coming from? You belong to which tribe?" if she said the clan of the father or the mother, in the morning the woman will take a hen and give her. Then she tells her that she is a relative either a brother, sister or cousin hence they cannot stay together. "What you do is that you go back home" the woman says. Then the girl leaves and if she does not get heed of instructions, or the boy says that he has already married her, the parents leave them. At the end things happen and they say it is because of marrying a relative. They may give birth to children who are not normal, they give birth to children who die, now they realize it later that one was a relative and things are worse now. Now children do not ask the others they just get married.</p>
