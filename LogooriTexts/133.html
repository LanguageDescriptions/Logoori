<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">A man with the second wife</p>
<p>My name is Caroline Chesi and I am going to speak about a person who marries two wives.</p>
<p>We had our neighbor who had married two wives. At first before this man married the second wife he had a good life. This man took good care of his children he also gave them food the way it is supposed. Even education he educated them well. He loved the first wife very much and when he got the first child he was very happy. His wife gave birth annually. This man when he received money he used to give to her wife to go and buy sugar for her mother and also buy a shirt to take to her father. This man as he was staying with the wife the children grew to go to school and he took them to a nursery. Since they were following each other they used to go together. These children this man loved them with all of his heart. When they were going to school they were not going by foot he used o carry them on a bicycle and takes them to school. He didn't beat them because he loved them and they were two boys. The wife added more children and they following each other.</p>
<p>When the wife added more children his life changed because he didn't have work. This man took his two children to primary school and they did their exams and they passed well. When they passed well he took them to secondary school. When he took them there they continued with the education and it reached a point where he was defeated to pay their school fees. He couldn't sustain all the children. He asked one of his children to repeat and the other one to continue while he was looking for money. The boy agreed to repeat and the other one continued with the education. He wife told him since the other children were following each other she suggested that they take them to a nursery school they continue with education. That man took his children to the nursery school. Life was tough to that man and it was sorrowful for the wife she didn't have energy since she had given birth to many children within near periods. </p>
<p>That man educated his two children and when the others were ready to go to class one he took them to a primary school. They continued with their education the two children did their fourth form examination. They stayed at home and they thought that their father would take them to do something when they pass their exams. The father married another wife. When he married another wife he started living another life. He went and stayed with the wife outside in Nairobi town. He started giving birth with the new wife to other children and the man didn't bother to know where he was coming from and even the children that he left at home. Even when he was granted a time to relax from work he was not coming home he was spending it with his wife. He got two children with the wife and they were boys. He loved those children very much and he forgot that he had other children at home. He took good care of those children from the second wife. The second wife asked him to start a business for him and if he doesn't she wont stay with him well. If he started the business they will assist each other to educate their children. He listened to what the wife told him and he opened for her a business. The wife continued with that business but there was a day when the wife whom he had left home told her children that she want to follow after and see where their father went they may be staying there while their father is dead. </p>
<p>They should know whether he is dead or alive. Because if they call he doesn't pick the phone and he doesn't call back to know whether the children are learning or starving that women began the journey because she knew where the husband was staying and when she got there she found the door closed. That woman stayed at the door until the husband came from work. The second wife had gone to the market to do her business and the husband found the first wife at the door and he asked her, "You've come for what?" the wife asked his husband to open the door they pray so that she tells her why she has come. The husband opened the door but he was tensing because he was afraid that if the second wife whom they are staying together finds this wife they wouldn't be in good terms. He asked the wife, "you have come here for how many days?" the wife didn't answer. He told her that she would stay there for two days as he carters for the expenses because he didn't ask her to come.</p>
<p>But because the wife who was staying at home was a Christian, she was not disturbing she said that she had listened and it will be like that. That woman persevered but when the wife who stays with the husband came she asked her, "You have come for what in my house?" she told her that she had come to see her husband and she doesn't have any issues with her because the husband doesn't come at home. Because when she rings he doesn't pick the phone and he doesn't call back home and he was wondering. She decided to come and check on him whether he was alive or dead. Since the second wife was quick to anger she wanted to fight her but the husband stopped her and told her that the first wife came to see whether he was alive or not and she came for a short while she will be going back home. She told her that if the wife doesn't go home she will run away from him and she should not spend the night in her house. Because the husband loved the second wife, he listened to what she told her. He went and looked for a place from the neighborhood where the first wife could sleep. The wife persevered the way the husband had asked her to do. He took her to the neighborhood to relax for two days. She went and slept there. He used to take food to the neighbor and tells that neighbor, "Do not tell my second wife that my wife is here, she will wait when I have gone to work and she comes and fight her" when the man got money he organized the way the wife could go back home. A day came she went home and the husband remained with his second wife in Nairobi. When the first wife arrived at home the children were very happy because their mother had returned back from Nairobi. They asked her to give them bread but she was disturbed because the husband didn't give her anything. She gave her the fare back home.</p>
<p>She persevered and lacked what to tell her children. That woman was persevering in her stay with her two children. Her two children continued with school and when they finished they went to look for work in Nairobi. When they got there they managed to secure jobs and they started to assist their mother. Even her house was going down they build her another good house and she forgot about the issues of her husband. That woman when the children got work she settled because the children were assisting her. They assisted her as they educate the younger children who were behind them. The husband got lost in Nairobi ha stayed with the wife and educated the children of that wife in good schools. Those schools were boarding he was educating his children from boarding secondary schools. Those children did their fourth form examinations and they passed and were called to universities. They went to university and finished and when they finished they were there. It was difficult for them to secure jobs. They were not getting jobs. They were like children who had not gone to universities and the people were wondering if the children had really gone to university. Life began being tough for that husband together with the wife. That man persevered in his life and he was afraid to return home because he wasn't assisting his children and the wife. It was difficult for them to earn something and house rent became a problem to pay. They started blaming each other. The second wife blamed the husband that the first wife had witched her children since her children were working. The second wife's children were not working and yet they had gone to university why? That man began thinking how he abused his wife and children but he was not finding solutions. </p>
<p>He got stressed up until he became sick. The second wife and the two children took him to the hospital and left him there. He was sick there and he looked like someone who had not given birth to children or had a brother. He looked like someone who had not married a lady. He stayed in the hospital without someone going to visit him. A good Samaritan checked through his phone contacts and called one of the people who knew him and it was one of brother who picked the phone. He asked him, "Do you know someone called John?" he said, "Yes I know him" he told him that he was in a hospital at Kenyatta ward number seven. The brother ran very fast to look for him. He found that he was very sick and he called one of the sons and told him that the father was very sick. The child was angry and he imagined how the father abused them. "Father abused us, he left us long time ago. Call his children that he took to the University"</p>
<p>The younger father to them told him that his father was still his father. He asked him to remove the curses from his life. Since the first wife was a Christian. She had shown them church. The child came to the younger father and asked him to take him to the hospital where the father was. They went to the hospital and they found that his father was asleep. The brother woke him up and told him that he was his brother and he also told him, "This is your child and he has come to see you" that man shake his sons hand and he told him, "My son have mercy on me I educated you but I didn't take you to a place where you can go to learn any skills, I also left you starving. I have mistreated you many days you also tell your mother that I didn't know what I was doing and you receive blessings." After saying that he called his brother and told him that if he dies he is the one that will represent him and he should know that he has two boys from the second wife. After saying that he stopped talking and after two days he died. The brother called his two wives and another brother and they started making plans how they can carry the body back home. After finishing the plans when it was time to take the body home the second wife was afraid of going home because of what she had done. She was afraid that the first wife and the children would beat her. They begged her to go home since she was staying with him she explains how they were staying but she refused she didn't go. The older brothers and the elder wife together with the children prepared and took the body back home. The second wife asked the brother and two old men to take the children to the funeral of their father but they should not sleep there. According to the culture of the Maragoli they took those children home and they told them to sleep there and watch after the body of their father and they wait they be shaved and taken to the church. Those old men listened to that and said that it is like that and the culture of Maragoli is usually like that.</p>
<p>The day of burial came and they buried. After burial the following day the people of the clan came and they asked themselves how the two children can be and how they can also get land since they belong to the second wife. They discussed and they called the administration together with the people of the clan. When they called the administration together with the people of the clan they partitioned the land in the middle. They gave one partition to he second wife and children and they remained with their partition. Those children went back where they were staying in Nairobi with happiness because they had known their home now. They knew that was home even when they come they are not afraid they are coming knowing that they are coming to their portion. That is all that I liked to tell you.</p>
<p>The way I was seeing our home while I was growing up.</p>
<p>At our home my grandmother was fellowshipping in a Cross church while my grandfather was fellowshipping in a Friends church. My grandmother used to go to church on Saturday while and they used to call it Sabato. When you met her and ask her where she was going she could tell you that she was going to Sabato. All the work they did it on Friday even picking vegetables they picked on Friday. They were not doing any other job on Saturday because they believed that their Sabbath day was on Saturday. My grandmother took some of her three children to that church of Cross. And my same grandmother didn't want someone who was smoking. She didn't want someone who was drinking alcohol in her home. Even the porridge that people were fermenting she didn't take it. We didn't ferment porridge at our home. Because she believed that the fermented porridge was like beer. She had refused such things in her home and my grandfather took his elder son to Friends church. They used to fellowship together and he told him that he was taking him to Friends church since the mother had found her followers and he wanted to walk with him. He accepted and they went to fellowship together in Friends church. The children that the grandmother went with learned that religion and they were baptized in that church of Cross. They fellowship in that church until they grew up like my father he didn't leave that church. He continued with that church until his death. And the other one who followed grandfather continued with that church until his death.</p>
<p>The children that our fathers gave birth to they didn't follow the laws. They are not religious like the fathers. Some are lost in drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes, weed and our fathers tried to discuss with them and they explained to them the way they grew up but they didn't listen. They told them that those were their days and they also have their days. When you have a child you should introduce the child to the church while still young. And if you do that your village will also have blessings when you wash yourself in preparation to the church they also wash and follow you. And when you leave these children from going to church they will get lost in the alcohol and the things of the world and your home will not be good. It is a place of war and swords. It is only that.</p>
