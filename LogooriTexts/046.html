<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">A woman with gourd milk</p>
<p>We had one woman who had three grandchildren. This woman liked fermenting milk. She used to keep her milk in the gourd. When day she fermented the milk and she went to the farm and when she came back she asked one of her grandchildren to prepare baked maize flour. When she went to cook, after that she asked her to bring the gourd that had milk for them to drink. She came and said "grandmother do you think there is milk inside here?" their grandmother began asking them who drank the milk. They began to deny. Then she asked them "if you are all denying that you didn't drink the milk then what came and drank it?" the children said that they do not know. One day she called them for a meeting and she told them "today, I see you are my children but you are doing me wrong</p>
<p>Whenever I ferment my milk inside the house I find that you have taken and drank, and when I ask you do not want to tell me, which other people do we have here? I only know of you" the children refused and began crying. Their grandmother told them "even if you cry I am with you" she asked one of the girls to look for a rope that they will use where the water separates. And when they reach there they are going to sing there. "Today I have to catch a thief who normally drink my milk" they went to the river, the first girl caught the rope and she began to sing</p>
<p>If I have drank milk</p>
<p>I am jumping ones as I go to the school</p>
<p>Oooh, school</p>
<p>Where we are schooling is far</p>
<p></p>
<p>That one crossed, the second one came</p>
<p>If I have drank milk</p>
<p>I am jumping ones as I go to the school</p>
<p>Oooh, school</p>
<p>Where we are schooling is far</p>
<p></p>
<p>The second one passed. When the third one came she was shy. She began to mumble. The grandmother told her to sing loudly. </p>
<p>If I have drank milk</p>
<p>The grandmother began to complain and the third time she asked her to sing loudly. Then she began to sing loudly. When she was singing the rope that was in her arm broke and she fell in water. When she fell in water the grandmother said that she had caught the thief. The one who has been drinking her milk? She has been caught. When she fell in water they took her from water and they went with her home and sat for a meeting. She begged for forgiveness from the grandmother and she forgave her. Then they began to have a good life. They were good children, and they grew with good morals. The story has ended there.</p>
