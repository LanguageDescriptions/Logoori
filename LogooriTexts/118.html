<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">A hyena</p>
<p>I will begin with a story.</p>
<p>My story is about a woman who was on the farm and she went to dig. While she was digging the hunters came chasing a hyena. When the wild dogcame it ran to where the woman was and it said "woman hide me." The woman took a basket and covered it. The hunters came and asked the woman "woman, a wild dogpassed through here have you seen it?" the woman said, "no I have not seen it." They asked again "woman the wild dogcame here and it lost, have you seen where it has gone?" and she said "no I have not seen that ogre." The hunters went and left the woman with the hyena. The woman continued to dig the farm. When it was in the evening the wild dogasked the woman to remove the basket. When she opened the wild dogtold her that it was very hungry and it wants her to give it what to eat. The woman said that she doesn't have anything instead she opened for it to go away. The wild dogsaid "I am not leaving before you give me what to eat, I will eat you." The wild dogwent and catched the woman and she began to scream. "woi woi the ogre is eating me" when the people came they told the woman "we asked you where the wild dog had gone and you said that you had not seen the wild dog, if it is eating you that is your own problem." The people ran away and left the woman being eaten by the wild dog. My story has ended there.</p>
<p>I have another story.</p>
<p>Girls were going on a journey. While on the journey they met ogres that asked them "where are you going?" and she answered "ah ah, I am going on a journey." They told her that she was not going on a journey, they requested her to sing for them before she leaves. The girl sang:</p>

<p>I want to talk on how girls were getting married long time ago; when they were going to ask for the girl. They used to say "we are taking her home, we are going to ask for the girl." When they arrived at the irls home they used to say "we have come here." Then they ask "what are you saying" we have brought here a cheeter and we want to take the girl. They used to say that they have seen a girl from that homestead. They used to say that they want to see the girl because they know her, the girl is good, she has good behaviours, she does not move up and down. She does not go to the road to look for boys the way other girls do. The girl stays at home. Then they ask and they go to tell the boy, "yes the parents have accepted and we shall bring you the girl" when they returned they used to give the boy the information. The boy's parents used to ask them "have you looked carefuly is she a good girl?" and they used to say that she is a good girl. Then they come to agreement. The boy meets the girl and the girl meets the boy then they ask them if they have agreed. The boy says "yes I have taken this girl she is good." They used to ask the girl and she agrees and says that the boy is good and she is getting married to him. Then they go and they plan the wedding. After that they went and made agreement on dowry. After agreement on the payment of dowry, the cows were not many they were two. </p>
<p>If they were many they were three between the year 1942 and 1943. They could ask if the wedding was for songs or matching. If it was for matching in a line people used to organize themselves. Girls and women used to say that they matching to the boy's home. They used to walk along with the girl then they arrive at the house of the boy, they were cooked food and they could eat then they leave the girl there as they return home. They used to do another type of wedding. They used to organize this wedding very well and the girl was given dowry of five cows. They used to tell the girl that the day has come that she was to go. They didn't take her there immediately they used to sing, from the home where the girl was staying. Even those who were at the boy's home they used to sing. When they got to the point of agreement that is when they got married. Long time they used to take a bag then they wrap it in a cloth. These days they call it suit case. They used to keep in their clothes. They could line up they used to pick on girls who had not engaged into any boy/girl relationship then they give her the suit case to carry it. They used to walk as they sang:</p>
<p>Awendende what shall I do</p>
<p>What shall I do ibudi yu mukeya</p>
<p>Awendende </p>
<p>I know personaly *2</p>
<p>The way I will carry myself</p>

<p>Awendende</p>
<p></p>
<p>They used to sing as they scream jubilantly</p>
<p></p>

<p>Children give me the rope</p>

<p>They used to sing like that during those years. When they were building on christianity, these days they sing like that and they are christians. That girl could finish seven days then they organize some people to take the girl back to her home wher she could be given presents, girls used to do that during those years. These days they are christians and they have left the type of wedding where people were matching in a line. People agree then they do the wedding. These days girls are being driven in  vehicles. These days girls are getting married and the instructions that were followed in the past are rarely considered. They take the bride to her home while driving her, because they have taken over the christianity. </p>
<p>When they follow the christianity they will say one has finished staying where she was born and now she is going to another home, she should stay there in peace, she should be used there and if she is called she should respond quickly. And when they send her she should go very fast. A good girl is praised and she walks freely in that home because the people have accepted her there. They say that she is the one that they call a wife. When christianity came in they assigned some women to advise the ladies who are getting married on the ways of staying in a marriage. They ask them to be low, they should fear their husbands, when a husband calls you, you should respond even if she has found him with nothing, they should come together on the farm and be hardworking people. If the husband has left her home she should remain there and not walk up and down in the village. People look and they say that the wife is good, the woman does work with her hands and she cook food for her children and she plans because one can get to a husband who is does not know work or he is lazy. If she is hardworking she makes the husband to have energy.</p>
<p>When he walks they say "yes this person is coming from here." Because God gave women instructions that they should teach other women. We live and we say that women should live a good life. A woman should wake up at the required time; at five o'clock. She should wake up and do her activities in her house and she should give food to her children. When her children comes home at 12 noon she should consider them and think of what her children can eat. And people know that the children are coming from a given home. If you look at the children they are clean, the woman is clean, she has dug the home and planted vegetables, maize and the things that are being used, she does not go out to borrow things. That is the reason to why we teach women. They are taught but you may find one has refused and she walks up and down in the village, she goes out to beg that she wants maize. People start to say that you borrow when the year is bad but if it is good, you do not borrow always. They used to teach women in the right way and good women used to prepare themselves in their ways. In the village if you have good women they make the village to look good. If you find a woman in the village who moves up and down, people look at the husband and they say that he does not have a wife. If a woman is humble she make the village to be good, she make her family to be good. When we go to the church after preaching to them we sing this song:</p>
<p>Listen*2</p>
<p>Good words</p>
<p>Come today, leave sin and let us follow the saviour</p>
<p>Hallelujah the kingdom of Jesus is great</p>
<p>We have been called we have gone to follow the saviour</p>
<p></p>
<p>A debtor*2</p>
<p>Who died for people</p>
<p>People died in the sin of the devil</p>
<p>Hallelujah the kingdom of Jesus is great</p>
<p>We have been called we have gone to follow the saviour</p>
<p></p>
<p>He is near, he is near</p>
<p>He can give you blessings</p>
<p>He is calling*2</p>
<p>All the people</p>
<p>Hallelujah the kingdom of Jesus is great</p>
<p>We have been called we have gone to follow the saviour</p>
<p></p>
<p>We should love him *2</p>
<p>The saviour of people</p>
<p>We should follow him *2</p>
<p>All the days</p>
<p>Hallelujah the kingdom of Jesus is great</p>
<p>We have been called we have gone to follow the saviour</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are saying that you should be the children of God. Follow the word of God. You should live in the required way and you should not move up and down. If you have gotten married to a husband who is lower than you and you are higher or better than him. You should trust him and know that he has given you a home, farm, toilet. You should be a wife who is able to take care of the house of God. We teach women to take care of their homes because these laws are hot these days. When you tell girls they say "no we are not able to handle that." a good girl is the one who keeps instructions even when she enters the house of God. She conducts herself in the right way.</p>
<p>she does not where short clothes that leaves the body outside naked. If she leaves the body naked we normaly say "woi this woman is not normal, she is a woman who has bad morals she is not trusting her husband" we preach and we ask them to read the book of John 3:16 that says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life. We teach them and ask them to walk in the right direction, after walking in the right direction you read the word of God and sing a song, when you sing a song you feel how it goes and they should be patient in their life. They should walk as they teach others because if three or two women walk well other women look at them and they decide to walk well. We have received the power of God. Another song goes like this:</p>
<p>Moses began the journey</p>
<p>To go to canaan</p>
<p>It was a difficult journey</p>
<p>They began to curse Moses</p>
<p>Let us go very fast to canaan</p>
<p>In the land of life</p>
<p>The one that God called for us</p>
<p>In the years of life</p>
<p></p>
<p>Moses together with Harun,</p>
<p>They were going through some struggles</p>
<p>To the children of Israel</p>
<p>They had hard hearts</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lets us go fast to canaan</p>
<p>In the land of life</p>
<p>The one that God called for us</p>
<p>In the years of life</p>
<p>Moses asked God</p>
<p>To tell him what to do,</p>
<p>God told Moses that he will give him everything that he wanted</p>
<p>Lets us go fast to canaan</p>
<p>In the land of life</p>
<p>The one that God called for us</p>
<p>In the years of life</p>
<p></p>
<p>Moses came from the hill, </p>
<p>He found that they had left the commandments</p>
<p>Commandments that they were given,</p>
<p>They bowed to gods</p>
<p>Lets us go fast to canaan</p>
<p>In the land of life</p>
<p>The one that God called for us</p>
<p>In the years of life</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Those that have faith</p>
<p>They will get to canaan</p>
<p>The way god called them</p>
<p>They will reach there in peace</p>
<p>Lets us go fast to canaan</p>
<p>In the land of life</p>
<p>The one that God called for us</p>
<p>In the years of life</p>
<p>We teach them like that and we tell them to walk in the right direction because Moses took the commandments of God. He took the commandments and God told him that he had chosen him, and Moses told him that he was a person who was a stummerer and he could not take care of people. But god told him that he had chosen him to take the children of Israel from Egypt. Moses led the Israelites from Egypt and the children of Israel troubled them when they were on the journey they regreted but Moses encouraged them to move on. Pharaoh planned war against the children of Israel, when Moses reached the sea, god told him to lead the Israelites and when he gets to the sea, he hit the sea with the stick that he had and the water moved to east and west. The water split and the Moses led the Israelites through the crossing and he brought them from the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>When he was getting tired he asked Joshua to lead them and the people who kept the commandments of God are the ones who followed the word of God. We should follow the commandments of God so that we can get atleast ten children who can lead this generation because this generation is difficult. It is a generation tha has difficult things, one that does not listen, adulterous, the one that is drinking beer, taking weed, even children are looking like children. When you look at it you realize that the world is spoiled. We are here we are struggling through this journey and we are praying God to guide the third generation. This generation is very difficult. We are perserviring and asking God to guide children in keeping the commandments. They should work and others should guide the rest and ask them to come out of those behaviours. Stubborn behaviours are not good you should struggle to work and take care of your houses and your houses will be good if you take care of them. A woman is the one who leads the house of a man. She is then called a good wife and she can keep the commandments and take care of others.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
