<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">How to prepare beer</p>
<p>My name is Esther Mmbone and I am going to give you the recipe for making a beer called "Ibusaa"</p>
<p>Long time ago old men used to prepare beer and they used to clean the pot. They fermented their flour for three days. Then they take a pan and they fry the fermented flour. After frying the fermented maize flour they poured it inside a pot. They used to grind it and then they mix it with millet then they plant a stick inside then they covered it with banana leaves. The banana leaves were covering the mouth of the pot. Then they allowed it to stay for two days after which they went and tasted it to see if it was ready to be taken.</p>
<p>They could check and find if it was ready to be taken. And they had tables for placing it on together with traditional straws that they used for drinking the beer. If the beer was ready to be taken they could serve it to the elders as they discussed their words. They used take their beer peacefully and they were not disturbing anyone like these days where people who are drank disturb people. After taking the beer they could leave the place and go home. After drinking that beer they started preparing another different beer called "Chang'aa" they prepared it in drums then they put it on fire.</p>
<p>They used to take a metal then they make a hole inside the bucket. Then they take hot water and put the metal inside. After it has become hot they used to take cold water too and they used to put there a bottle and then they collected the steam and put it inside another bucket. They didn't sleep until morning. They could even do it for two days without sleeping. They used to take there beer and they didn't disturb anyone. The present generation adds weed and other things to the beer. They used to add in sugar when they were cooking it then they gave people to drink. They were drinking their beer in peace. Nowadays the young people drink the beer and then they start fighting and saying bad things that are not supposed to be spoken. </p>
<p>Long time ago the girls were told by their grandmothers not to hear anything that was being spoken by boys. They were to move ahead even if they heard boys speaking. The ones who took heed of the instructions got home safety but the ones who didn't hear they were carried on the shoulders and taken to the home of the boys. They stayed there until they got married. Then someone could tell them that we have seen them somewhere and they could go and find them there.</p>
<p>The owner of the house could say, since the girl is at home, they parents should come for cows. They could agree but nowadays if you go to take the cows no one gives them to you. If he has given you one then that's all. Those days were good and there was no food, women used to go and buy milk then they come to cook so that they can eat. They could eat some on the road since they were hungry. They could arrive home then they prepare the food and eat then they take water. It is until recently when food came. They used to keep their food in traditional granaries, these days they put it in sucks but before a week ends the rodents are already in. This has caused the food not to last for long.  </p>
<p>There was a woman and a man. They had stayed for 15 years without getting a child. God gave them a child on the 16th year the child was a boy. They child grew and they left him food at home and they asked him to stay at home as they went to church. When they came they didn't find the child at home. They searched everywhere but they didn't see the child. They had dug a deep pit, they found the child had taken the mattress and laid it inside.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They came and asked "where are you Isaac?" they heard him speaking from the pit, "I am here mother" they went and wondered who had put him inside, whenever they put in a hand he could fall back. And he could say "ywi ywi ywi ywi." They continued until they started wondering what was happening. They called people to come and help them to remove the child from the pit. They tried but the child was still falling inside and they said that they were hungry and they needed to go and prepare meals. They came and found the child on the matress. He was still on the matress. There was a snake that was holding this child and it got hold of this child.</p>
<p>I want to tell you another story.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There were boys who used to go the forest. Then they start to sing: </p>
<p>Cowboys could have given me then I give them my sticks*2</p>
<p>The sticks were not mine they belonged to the cowboys who gave me</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cowboys could have given me then I give them my cows*2</p>
<p>The cows were not mine they belonged to the cowboys who gave me,</p>
<p>Cowboys could have given me then I give them my millet*2</p>
<p>The millets were not mine they belonged to the people who hit them</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cowboys could have given me then I give them my sticks*2</p>
<p>The sticks were not mine they belonged to the cowboys who gave me</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I want to sing for you a song that was sang long time ago.</p>
<p>The well in heaven has good water, those who will go to drink it will never have thirst again*2</p>
<p>Dare and come</p>
<p>come</p>
<p>Repent</p>
<p>Come and enter the new Jerusaleum</p>
<p>Gossiper come</p>
<p>Come </p>
<p>Repent </p>
<p>Come and enter the new Jerusaleum</p>
<p>Criticiser come</p>
<p>Come </p>
<p>Repent </p>
<p>Come and enter the new Jerusaleum</p>
<p>Long time ago girls used to find out whenever someone had died, they could say the donkey has kicked something, then they go out on foot to find out where someone had died. They used to go along with their cousins. They used to go and dance the traditional dance. Even if the dead stayed for three days they used to stay there for three days.  They could look for another place where someone has died and they go there and dance. They didn't have other issues the way they do nowadays. This world of today is spoiled, sometimes they take their cousins, the father take even there children. These days things are not the same as of the past days. Girls had respect but these days they do not have respect.</p>
