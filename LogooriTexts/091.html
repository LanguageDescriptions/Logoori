<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Girls who went to visit friends</p>
<p>We had six girls and these girls went to a party to visit their friends who had invited them. When they arrived there they were treated well the way visitors are treated. They went back home; on the way there were six ogres that were waiting for them. And they told each other that each ogre should pick one of the girls. "We have found wives," the ogres said. The girls were treated well. While on the way the ogres were following them behind slowly. They arrived near a river and it had flooded, and the ogres were behind them. The girls sang this song:</p>
<p>Go and tell father and mother*2</p>
<p>Girls have gone to their friends</p>
<p>The river has blocked the way nzilililili *2</p>
<p>An old man heard it and wondered what the people were saying. The second child sang:</p>
<p>Go and tell father and mother*2</p>
<p>Girls have gone to their friends</p>
<p>The river has blocked the way nzilililili *2</p>
<p>The old man asked his wife "are you listening to what I am hearing?" girls left this place saying that they were going to a ceremony, the river has flooded and they do not have a place where they can cross. And come back home. The third girl sang, the fourth girl did the same until the sixth girl sang. When the sixth girl sang the old man asked his wife if she heard what the girl was singing. And the wife said that she was not hearing. He asked her to listen. The sixth girl began to sing:  </p>
<p>Go and tell father and mother*2</p>
<p>Girls have gone to their friends</p>
<p>The river has blocked the way nzilililili *2</p>
<p>When the old man heard that he took a stick and went up to the river where the water was. He took the stick and hit the water then he said "one water should move to the sisters side and the other water to move to the mothers side, water move" the water separated in two different directions. The girls crossed and went home, and then the ogres came. When they came they told Khasi "we were following after our girls, have they come here" the old man asked the ogre to come and cross the way the girls had crossed. The ogres came and they had gathered themselves together. The old man asked them to come together since they were together. </p>
<p>The old man hit the water again with the stick and said "one water to come from the mothers side and the other water to come from the fathers side, water come together" the water came together and the ogres drowned and died. The girls crossed and went home. When they went home they felt good because of their song that they sang and their father and mother heard it then they came and rescued them from the ogres. It teaches us that whenever you hear someone asking for help on the road, you should not hesitate, be wise. The ogres wanted to eat those girls. When their father and mother heard them singing, they came and rescued them. It has reached there.</p>
