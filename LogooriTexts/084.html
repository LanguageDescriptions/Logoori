<p>Long time ago we had a woman and her husband. A man married a wife and they were staying in the house as usual. They had several kids. Then the man engaged in men's activities of admiring other women, he wants this woman and also another woman. He chose to go and have another wife. Then he left the house and went. The wife looked after him but he was nowhere to be seen. The wife thought that it was over. The woman began her new life. It was difficult even feeding the children, getting the clothes for children was a problem. One day she went to the forest. She saw things like vines had sprouted.</p>
<p>She wondered what those things were. She du down and uprooted something that looked like a sweet potato. She ate it and realized that when it got into the stomach there was no problem, she bites another one and ate. She felt like it was food and she had stayed hungry with her children, she thought of taking some to her children. She took those things and went with them to her home, she cooked them and gave them to her children and they ate and slept. She didn't hear them complaining of sickness. The following morning she decided to go back and take the remaining ones, since her children had ate and slept well without any problem. She went back and dug the remaining ones then she came with them at home and cooked them.</p>
<p>And that man has just gone. They are staying in a small house, the home is bushy and there is no one to cut the grass. That man has left the woman went and dug the remaining ones and she brought them, cooked and they ate. One day when she had gone to look for other vines the husband came and secretly.</p>
<p>He found the children were there and they were neat and he asked them what they were eating. The children asked him who he was. He told them that he was their father. The children told him that they do not know someone like father. They do not know him, "you are someone else who wants to quarrel us here" the children said. He said "no I am your father " and he asked them what they were eating. They said that their mother normally goes out then she comes with things and they eat. The man said that he was not leaving he will stay and see those things. When the woman came she resumed her tasks because she knew her husband well. She cooked them and brought them on the table and they ate. The husband ate and realized that they were good. What he did is that he slept and never went.</p>
<p>The following morning the woman left and went to look for other vines, when she came back she found that the husband had reshaped his home. The grass that was on the house had been removed the home was clean, and it was clear that the husband had returned to his home. That is a story that teaches us we women when we find ourselves in such situations we should persevere. Do not think of getting another man because your man has left children for you or leave to the place that you want. Just persevere. That is it. </p>
