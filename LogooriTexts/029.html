<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">A person who is ready to marry</p>
<p>This story is about the lifestyle of someone. To show if he was mature enough to marry a wife, a boy who is ready to marry or a girl who is ready to get married.  There were people who could gather them and teach them. The girls were taught by their mothers, or their grandmother. And the boys were taught by their grandfather or uncles. The way a boy worked determined whether he was ready to marry. Others could ask the boy to dig a certain large portion of land, after he has finished then they figure how others can come to finish digging.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If he finished digging the land, they knew that he was a responsible man enough to take care of his house. The other thing he was tasted on was how to build a house. The reason is that even a bird before laying eggs it has to build a house for laying eggs. The bird uses beak to build but a man has hands and eyes. If a bird can build a house and you have hands you should then build your house. He could go to cut trees from the forest. And make ropes, and build his house. A boy could go and cut tree and some plants for making ropes since they were not sold. He could make ropes for building his house. When the boy finished building the house they knew that he was able to take care of his wife.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the process of marrying, whenever you found a girl to marry it was good for one to consult his parents about it. The parents could then find out which house you were marrying from. The reason is that we have different houses; we also have some houses that have witches. If you marry from a house of witches you may end up not having a good life. You may die before the right time. It was also good to do so since you can marry a relative, something that was not allowed even today relatives do not intermarry. If you marry a relative there are things that move through blood hence making one not to live well?</p>
<p></p>
<p>There was a way that people from the boy side could visit the girl's side. And consult on making plans about the wedding. The wedding was arranged well. After they had confirmed that the boy was not a relative, and the girl is from a good family, the father to the girl could visit the boy's home and he could join old men and make plans about the dowry. Dowry is the present that the boy gives t the parents of the girl for taking care of her. The way the mother took care of her as she grew up. And long time ago the dowry was inform of cows. And if they had planted food they also added it on top. Like the wheat and millet. If dowry has been paid, a girl cannot get married to another person. They arranged for a day, when a girl could move around by others. As the friends move to where she was heading, this was the right way for someone to marry a wife.</p>
