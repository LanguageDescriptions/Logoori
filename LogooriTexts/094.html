<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Thieves</p>
<p>I am Benjamin Egadwa Okodi and I want to show you how we can deal with the cases of theft. The way we were solving cases of theft long time ago. Our grandfathers when they found thieves in the village that they were staying in their work was this: the thieves were caught and taken before the elders. The leders were like leaders in the village. Like the village elder and his police. These thieves were caught with what they had in their arm. </p>
<p>If these thieves went and broke into someones house while he is not there, when the owner came back and realised that the thieves had broke into his house and they are known. And when they broke in they broke the pudlock and they stole his clothes and blankets from this house. The people in the village together with the elders had to go and confirm the things that were stolen and also know if the thieves have been found. These thieves were caught and taken to the field where they used to solve such cases. They then prosecuted the thieves with theft case. The prosecutors who were the village elders could inquire the reason to why the thieves went to take those things without permision. Then the case begins because the person who was stolen from has the witness near who will be able to mention the names of the people who were involved in the theft. Once they receive the names of those people who stole, they are then caught and brought to the field (Lushia mean an open place where matters are solved openly in front of a huge crowd) they caught together with the items that they stole so that the case can proceed on. The village elder is the one who ask the questions in front of people. They are asked "are you the people who stole items from this woman in her house?" some may deny and say that they did not, and yet they are found with the exhibit inside their house, they have blankets. </p>
<p>They stole matress and clothes and they are found that they are the true thieves. And if the village elders see that they are denying they will insist, and inform them that their case has to be finished at the field. Are they telleing the truth or not, the thieves can admit yes they did or they deny that it is not true and the elder asks them questions because the witnesses are already there.</p>
<p>After they finish to witness, they say that they saw the thieves stealing from the house. The village elder will then weigh the matter, if they agree they will finish the case from the field and if they deny, he will have to take the case to the police station. These thieves will be tied their hands and when they reach at the police staion they will be asked the same questions. Then they will write a new statement again, that they have been found stealing from someone's house and their exhibit have been found then they are pushed to the court.</p>
<p>Once they have been taken to court there is no forgiveness there. As they are taken there they are told that they were found with the things and they should now be jailed. The judge is an old person who has listened to such cases and they are asked questions if they will agree infront of the court. The judge will tehn take them to a tree palnted near the court together with the sword that is near the tree, together with the pot of water and the judge carrys the bible and swore them, and they carry the bible to say that they didn't do it. If you agreed that you did it, you will be safe, and if you denied while you carry the bible you spear the sword into the tree then you wash your hands inside the pot that has water that was drown from the huge pot with drinking water. After washing your hands, when you leave the place, you do not survive. You could leave the place and you couldn't even go to the riever because the tree was highly respected and you could not play with it. </p>
<p>If you agreed you didn't wash your hands inside the water, or carry the bible or wash spear the sword into the tree, you were handcuffed and taken to the jail, then you stay there for the peiod that you were sentenced then you will be released. And if you refused you will not go to jail, and finish your sentence. And the judge goes and sentence you that you go to jail to be given discipline since you were found in someones house on theft issue. You caused loss in their house or you stole things from their house. People used to see that and they feared theft activities. They knew that if you are found stealing you will be taken to court and you can come out of the place and die.</p>
<p>From there theft cases reduced and people were not thieves. And the people who were stealing in most cases they were drunk, people who do not know God. When the world changed, the christians came in most of the people joined christianity and the theft issues reduced. They didn't continue with theft issues. The way I said, the drunk people are the ones who used to steal. Theft is reduced since people began to go to schools, to go and gain knowledge. And we saw it was good to have a government that can stop theft. That is why it was made that thieves should be taken to court, and at the court you can die while inside there.</p>
<p>Young children who were found guilty with theft cases they were sentenced on probation and an officer was dealing with them while they were outside. He could ask the parents to be giving report until the probation is over. If they have been sentenced for three years he/she should give a report until the three years is over. They won't repeat the same mistakes because they will be taken to the jail because they are guilty. The world is good today, the probational officers do not have work, these days people have gone to school, children are clever, they have changed their way of life. They are staying at peace with their family. That is all that I wanted to tell you, from Benjamin Egadwa.   </p>
