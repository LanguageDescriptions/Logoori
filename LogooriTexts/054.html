<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">A woman who denied her child food</p>
<p>We had a woman and this woman had food to eat. Her grandchild came and asked "grandmother give me some food I want to eat." That woman denied the child. After her meals were over the child went and found his food. When he found his food, and the woman's food is over, she went to the child and said "you child hunger has finished me, give me food I eat" the child asked her "what? I came and you denied me your food, now you want who to prepare food for you, you denied me" now the child began singing for the woman:</p>
<p>Ndiegu went to look for food, she denied the child</p>
<p>And the child went to look for food and denied Ndiegu</p>
<p>Ndiegu why are you crying</p>
<p>Tsunu tsunu tsunu.</p>
<p>That tsunu means that when you denied me, you felt good. Now that I have found, you go and I have denied you too. You also feel the way I felt when you denied me. That is the Tsunu tsunu tsunu.</p>
