<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Teachings</p>
<p>We have some teachings but we do not follow some, or we do not know them.</p>
<p>They normally say that do not see your mother with wrinkles and you say that father threw cows.</p>
<p>When you say, a young child or children of these days wont understand the meaning. They mean that when your mother got married to your father, you were not born. You never saw her when she was still a girl. Your mother has been there she has given birth to you, she is now old, she is doing her activities. When you see her getting confused you now start saying "father brought what, what drove him to this thing?" and where she came from you do not know.</p>
<p>They also say that it is better to stay with a selfish person than a witch.</p>
<p>Because a selfish person will deny you today and you will deny him tomorrow. But if you stay with a witch he will witch you but you wont witch him. It is to stay with a selfish person than a witch.</p>
<p>Go far and reach.</p>
<p>If you want to go to Shamakhokho and the road is under construction, you are told that there is another route far away, if you use that route you will get to Shamakhokho and you say, what the whole distance I will just use this short one. And maybe the road is impassable and it is night, when you get there you fall in the ditch that was dug. When you fall in that ditch haven't you found yourself in trouble, if you had followed what you were told, you could not have fallen in the ditch.</p>
<p>They also say the firewood that is up on the roof laughs at the one that is burning in fire. It means that they are keeping some in the fire while the other one is laughing. It means when someone has an issue or a problem, do not laugh at that problem, or speaking at that problem. Because when you speak about it "look at this and that" yours is on the way coming and they will defeat you to handle them. When yours comes it will be difficult. Thank you.</p>
