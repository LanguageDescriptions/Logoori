<p>Yu mugeli ihila mu kesegese - yaga gamanyia ndi mundu naveye utahula mang'ana naveye na mang'ana gege vandu vandi si vamukonya dave, valeka akola weng'ine.</p>
<p>Chu kumatsi kegona vuruhu - vandu vanyinge vaveye vagata vasula kokola igasi yavo mmwiyangu vuveye ho. Lwa vwiyangu vwene yivu vufwetsa galoleka vandi vavavita vatsia imbili.</p>
<p>Mbiushukane yashia munwa - yaga ni kumanyia ndi mundu wayanza komolomela lialola amoloma ku; amoloma ku yili amoloma ku yili na handi aveye na giligale gene da. Gamanya galoleka lwa giligale ganyoleka vamanya vamulauma ku vindu via avetsa nakoli vitaveye via giligale. Gamanyia utingila mu mang'ana ga utamanyi dave.</p>
<p>Evembe ni ivina utavina ku mba - yaga gakovola ndi nolola vandu vakola kindu cha utamanyi vakola kijira ki dave, umanyi kivune chene dave, utavalonda dave. Oleka vakola mang'ana gavo. Nuvita havundu vandu vaveye mu mang'ana gavo ga vakola na umanyi kivune dave utingilamu dave ganyala kokoletela vudamanu.</p>
<p>Amavuli ni gaburuka utalia ku mba - amavuli ni aina ya tsiswa tsitula hamugorova vakong'onda dave; tsiveye kuli tsiswa tsie kitunda. Yivi ni vindu vinyoleka mu inzila ya vwangu. Ku nolola vindu viveye via vwangu via vagavula sana sana via vutsa utegomba kuvugula vindu via vutsa dave; vivetsa na mang'ana ga vio. </p>
<p>Mukana mulavu afunya kevove - yili ni ling'ana liatumikilwaa kuhana vulavu ku vasoleli; vayayi vaveye himbe konyola inyumba yavo anoho koleta mukali. Vanyinge vayanza kohenza mukana aveye ni ligondo. Mukana kuli mwene oyo vandu vanyinge vamwegomba. Vakamwegomba ndio valeta vulwani vandu vanyala kwitanila ku. Kevove ni kindu chafunya vugundu. Ku mukana mulavu ni umwegomba umanye gaveyo imbili gakulinda.</p>
<p>Kanyonyi kivalavali si kali ni mwayo - yiki ni kifwananyilo cha kandi vandu vayanza komolomela. Koveye na vandu igasi yavo ni komoloma. Ni aveye ha vandu vandi vaveye yekola malenge. Onyola ni oyo weng'ine yenya amolome. Navutsa nohenzelitsa mang'ana ga amoloma onyola gaveye mu ni kivune da; yicho kojira vakulu vavola; kanyonyi kivalavali si kali ni mwayo.</p>
<p>Walega mukali yalega enzogu - mundu mukali ni mundu mulahi wu komenya naye. Na giligale gaveye aveye nu vwongo vwi imbili kuvita mundu musatsa. Kivune anyala kutula yengo wavo yatse amenye hinyu na onyole yalomba ho yagwa yengo kabisa. Ku kandi si genyekananga ave mundu wu kuhenzelitsa dave. Numuhenzelitsa ni yili naye agilung'anyia yili. Yicho chajila vakulu vavola Walega mukali yalega enzogu.</p>
<p>Ovosera vwa sunduka ku kevoya - kevoya ni inguvu ya vivikanga anoho mu ling'ana linde chinatsilu. Vavohanga mu kisindi na iyo yali inguvu ya vandu vivikanga  yeng'ine. Ku ni ulitsa chukulia ma kisunduki ku ma kandi wilane kulia da. Yaga gamanyia ndi koveye ho ni vindu vilala ni vionechi vitsili tsa ku gene yago; ma uvigilung'anyie wilanyie inyuma da. Kuli lidiku lia kalunu lifweye livetsa lifweye, ubange mang'ana ga na okole lidiku lilonda ku. </p>
<p>Uluku lwu kwilungu loseka lwu mmashiga - luku kutumikilanga kwenya kodeka. Na yiki chali kifwananyilu tsingu vavikanga shimbe havafwana mulilu ahigulu halangwa llungu. Na luku nuvika lwaduka mulu paga lugwa rigoke. Gwafwananyia ndi koveye na vandu valola ni uvitila mu mang'ana gaveye madinyu vayanza kokoseka kandi vagenda vavola vandu mang'ana gene yago ligali. Navutsa vivilanga ninze kalunu na yive ni mugamba. Gakoleka ku yinze kalunu na yive kandi mugamba nolole gakolechi. Uluki lwu kwilungu loseka lwu mmashiga.</p>
<p>Utalola nyia navukana dada yata vutsa tsing'ombe - gamanyia ndi nolola mundu mukere anoho musakulu wivila kumanya lidiku lilala yali ku mwana mukee. Yali musakulu kutula yilwo da. Vandu vanyinge nivalola vandu vasakulu anoho vandu vakele vavamanyianga liva litaveye lilahi. Heshima yageha kutula mu vandu vanyinge.

Kuli kunyala kovola inzala ni iruma mundu na oveye ni chukulia ni vulahi kumuha ku kijira lidiku lilala kandi na yive inzala ilakuluma ku. Na onyola mundu mula inzala niluma undi naye aseka yivila kumanya ndi naye kandi inzala yamuluma ku.</p>

<p>Lwevolo na amatsi ga maganda - malala mere vandu vayanza kandi komoloma; vamoloma ku yaga, vamoloma ku yaga. Ma vandu valuha vagenya uyu yamanya vutsa mang'ana gosi? Yiki ni kimanyilu kuli kwamanya amatsi ga maganda vatsuchi havundu gaduka havundu gatulitsa mwika mudamanu. Ni vulahi kwevola vuli lwosi dave, umanye ufwananywa nu mwika mudamanu.</p>

<p>Litu si liamanya lilakave lilala dave - litu ni isehemu yu musala anoho vitagwa. Na nilikiri ridoto livetsanga ninde liva lilahi linifu navutsa lwa madiku gatsitsagilanga lisunda liviluka onyola liagilung'ana ma liuma. Kutanga litanga lifwana kuli mayaye, ma ligulung'ana litanga kwuma. Ni liakuma liveye ni ifaida inyinge da. Vandu ni kukala nu kutulitsa ku musala. Ni ndio kandi limenya lia vandu liveye.

<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Maragoli proverbs</p>
<p>I am Stanley Mugalo and today we want to know proverbs for the maragooli. I will start every proverb and give the meaning.</p>
<p>The one who thinks to be clever drives toward the roof - this one means that when one doesn't abide to instructions given, when he/she gets in trouble people do not assist, they let him/her do it alone.</p>
<p>The one on the water sleeps thirsty - most of the people are lazy, they refuse to do their work within the given time. When the time is over it happens that the others overtake the lazy ones.</p>
<p>Mbiushukane burned his mouth - this one is showing someone who likes talking whenever he sees something he talks, he speaks about this and that and maybe he doesn't have the truth. It means when the truth comes out they will blame him for the things that he has spoken that are not true. It shows that you should not get into the things that you do not know. </p>
<p>When thatched grass shakes do not shake - it means that when you see people doing things that you do not know, why they are doing it and you do not know the reason. Do not follow them. You leave them to do their things. When you pass nearby and you see people doing their things that you do not know why they are doing it, do not engage yourself inside, they can cause you problems. </p>
<p>When birds fly do not eat - they are types of birds that gets out in the evening, and they do not shake. These are things that are found easily, when you see thins that are easily acquired and they are taken for free, in most cases do not be fond of taking them they also have their issues.</p>
<p>A white girl smells a bad odor - this is a word that was used to show light to the unmarried people; boys who were near to get married or marry a wife. Most of them used to look at the skin. Many people admired a girl like that. After admiring her like that it brought war and people could kill one another because of her. "Kevove" is something that smelled bad. If you married a white girl you should know that issues are waiting for you ahead there. </p>
<p>When a bird is moving up and down it has a heart - it is and example of people who like talking. Their work is to talk. When he is where people are he is the one to speak. He found that he is the only one to speak, but when you look at what he is speaking it doesn't have any value. That is the reason to why the elders said; when a bird is moving up and down has a heart</p>
<p>The one, who defeated a wife, has defeated an elephant - a woman is a good person to stay with, in real sense she has more brain than a man. The reason being that she can leave her home, to come and stay with a man and make a home there fully. She should not be someone that you look after. When you look after her because of this and she change the other one. That is the reason to why the elders said; the one, who defeated a wife, has defeated an elephant.</p>
<p>The porridge poured on the cover - this is the cover that was used long time ago when the clothes were not there. They used to tie it around the waist and that was the only cloth that people were putting on. Whenever you were eating food and it gets poured over it, you could not continue to eat it again. It means that there are something when they are spoiled they get wasted like that. You cannot turn them back, like the present day, when it ends it is over, you plan about the things that you can do the following day.</p>
<p>The roof firewood laughs at the one that is on fire - we use firewood when we want to cook. And this was an example, firewood are kept near where they light fire, and when you light the fire the firewood used to burn until it becomes ash. It means that there are people when they see you going through tough things they like it and laugh and they walk and tell people about the situation. But they forget that it is you today and tomorrow it will be them. They happen to me today, and tomorrow it will be you. The roof firewood laughs at the one that is on fire.</p>
<p>Do not see your mother old with your father and you say that father threw cows - it shows that when you see an old woman you tend to forget that she was once a young lady. She was not old from the past. When many people see old people or old women, they do not treat them well. Respect is lacking from many people. When you see an old person remember that one-day he was strong like you. He was a child he grew up into a teenager until he got to the condition in which he is in. do not look at him and think that he was just like that. He should be given his honor.</p>
<p>The ones operated were laughing each others wound - it means that there are some who see something bad on someone and they turn back and reflect that they were once like that. For example when hunger is finishing someone and you have food it is good you give him/her because one day you are also going to be hungry. And you find one person when hunger is finishing him/her you get someone laughing forgetting that he/she will be hungry too.</p>
<p>Hunger took wild dog to the urban - this is an example of an animal that stays in the wilderness. It is not easy to find it getting out of the forest as it walks. That is the reason to why they said hunger took wild dog to the urban. Whenever you found a wild animal out of the forest walking, it shows that it was hungry. If you found someone coming to the home of another person who rarely pays visit then you know that there is a problem that has brought him/her there. Hunger took the wild dog to the urban.</p>
<p>Speaking with beans water - it is the same thing, people who like talking. They are speaking about this; they are also speaking about that. People used to hear that then they wonder that this person knows everything. This is a sign the way we know the beans water when poured somewhere they produce bad odor. It is not good to speak about yourself every time. You should know that you are like the bad odor.</p>
<p>You are coming, you have forgotten - you can wrong for someone and that person forgives you. And when that person wrongs you, you become angry and you want to spoil the friendship forever and you do not remember that you were once in a problem and you were assisted. You are coming, you have forgotten.</p>
<p>The leaf didn't know that it can be alone - it is a part of the tree or planted things. And while it is young it has a good condition; very clean. But when the days move on, and grow and you find that it has changed and dried. It first looks yellowish then it get dry. When it is dry it doesn't have any value when people cut and remove the tree. That is how the life of people is. People grow from childhood with a lot of energy then they become old men and women. When you see them old, you should remember that they were once young and clean like you. And he/she didn't know that he/she would be the way they are. We have some things in our live that come and pass. They do not take long. It is the same as the person who came home one day then he goes back again. Some liked when someone comes home you do not see that person well. They wanted to show them that they are nothing but you should know visitors some come for a short while and they pass. </p>
<p>I also want to tell you riddles, we shall speak in the normal way riddles in other terms. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Riddle?</p>

<p>There is another riddle that says a cow mow's on behalf of all other cows: it shows that where people are many one can be in need of something and when he asks you see others need it too. When a cow mows it means that the rest need to drink water too or they are hungry.</p>

<p>Riddle?</p>
