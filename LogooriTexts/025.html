<p>Lugano lundi ni kulondekana na nende erive nende engoko. Liduku llala lyari ho engoko yenya kutsya mu vugeni. Na wa vaziza mu vugeni galoreka mundu atsi nari munihu. Engoko yamanya ni ilola eve na masande matambi. Ni yenya itsi kusava cha enyala kukala. Gamanya galoreka ndi wa anyala kunyola lugembe ni kulive lwonyenye. Yamanya na atsya kuteva rive unyala kukonya ku lugembe. Kigira kutsa vugeni. Rive ryamanya limmbola ni vulahi. Nu umala kukala masande lugembe lwange wenye wiranye. Engoko yamanya ni izya ni ivugula lugembe, ni ikala masanda ga yo.</p>
<p>Ni yivila kwiranya chigira isaa yari ni ifwele. Ni ivugula lugembe ni ivika havundu. Na viminyoli vana va ingoko vamanya vavugula lugembe yolo. Vatsya kukinira, lwa vatsya kukinira, ni lugota. Rive ryamanya ni litsa ni liteva engoko lwa uvugule lugembe lwange, kina kimanya kikoreka. Engoko yamanya ni ivola lugembe mbe na lwo, lwa malile kukola igasi ya ndenyi kukola, manya ni nyola vana vanje ni vavugule. Havaviki ndola dave. Unyala kumba ku vwiyangu mbenze lugembe lweneyolo. Rive ryamanya ni livola ngohe vwiyangu, uhenze chigira ni lwa muhimu ku inze. Engoko yamanya ne evola reka nzi kuhenza. Engoko yamanya ni izya halala na viminyo, ni yitsya kusagala.

<p>Another story is about, the eagle and the hen. There was a day when a hen wanted to attend an event. And where they were going, everybody was expected to be clean. The hen saw that it had long nails. And it wanted to go and borrow what it can use to cut the nails. It came out clearly that she could only get the razor from the eagle alone. She went and asked the eagle if it can assist her the razor blade. Because she was attending an event. The eagle agreed that it is well. She asked her to return his razor blade when she finishes the event she was attending. The hen went and took the razor blade. And it cut its nails.</p>
<p>The hen forgot to return the razor blade, and it took the razor and kept it somewhere. And the chicks took that razor blade; they went to play with it. Then it got lost. The eagle came and asked the hen when she took his razor blade, what happened? The hen replied that the razor blade is available. When I finished using the razor blade I found my children have taken it. I am not seeing where they kept it. Can you give me some time I look for it? The eagle agreed and told her that he had given him some time. You look for it because it is of great value to me. The hen told him that it is going to look for it. The hen went together with her chicks to look for it. But they did not find it. They went to the grass but they did not find it. The eagle came and found that the razor blade had lost. </p>
<p>The eagle asked her what he could do, because she had taken his razor blade and lost it. It seems that he could not find another one. The hen told him that it will continue to look for it and when she found it she will give it to him. But it reached a point where the razor blade could not be found. The eagle became angry and told her that it seems that his razor blade was nowhere to be found. And now I want you to pay me. And if you do not pay me I will pay myself. I will be coming always to take away your children as a compensation for my razor blade. If you check out today the eagle and the hen are not friends. Every time the eagle comes and takes the chicks. The reason is because his razor blade got lost. And the hen is still searching. It search in the soil and calls her chicks. It can search the whole day, the only work that it does is to search for it. It seems like the hen is still looking for the razor blade that got lost. And the eagle is still taking the chicks because his razor blade got lost.  The hen is searching because it wants the razor blade that got lost.</p>
