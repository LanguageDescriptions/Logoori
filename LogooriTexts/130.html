<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Men who used to go to war</p>
<p>My names are Esther Mmbone; I am going to tell you how people were fighting in the past. Men in the past used to go to war and they were not sleeping; they were sleeping in the forest because they were looking after the people and the animals. They were looking after how their people were staying. They were walking slowly in order not to be seen. They were walking with spears, swords, arrows and the boys were the ones who were leading in front. And the old men were the ones who were behind those boys. </p>

<p>Riddle?</p>
<p>Answer</p>
<p>And we meet: shadow</p>
<p>People in the past used to do funny things in the forest like this; they were going at their own time, those people were not waiting for the elephants in their war. These days people do not rush the way they used to rush and fight in the past. They used to set their trap, they were not attempting they were in troops the way they wanted and they were planning for their attack without letting anyone to know. With arrows, sword, spears they were led by the elders in their forests.</p>
<p>They were not staying much in the house. People who were staying in the house were called the bereaved; women, pregnant women, elder men who were unable and all the people who were sleeping during the war. They were not fighting in their land that has peace. It was when they found the person beyond their boundary. They were talking with the animals in the forest. They were looking for ants in order to get their meals. They didn't have meals; they were eating these things in order to get energy to fight in the forest where they were living. They also had vegetables and they were staying in the forest with the things that they were eating.</p>

<p>I have a story:</p>
<p>There was a preacher in the village where we go for church and asked, "is this the church of PAG?" the teachers who were at that school said, "yes" and "the home of the representative of the house is where?" he asked they told him that it was there. They took him there. When they took him there he knocked and they welcomed him. He said that he is a pastor and he visits churches and prays. He prayed and sat and they greeted him and it was on a Saturday. When they greeted him he said that he will fellowship with them on Sunday. They said that they want preachers. He said that he is called Harun, they welcomed him and they made food and he ate. They spread well a place for him to sleep. In the morning they gave him water to bath and they prepared food they ate and went to church.</p>
<p>He stayed like that then he prayed for the meal that e ate and then he said that it was time to go to the church and he was a preacher who was visiting churches. When he arrived at the church they welcomed him, he said his name and where he was coming from and they said that he was a preacher. They stayed and continued with the service and when they reached to the session f visitors they made him to stand; when he stood he said where he was coming from. They prayed for him as a visitor and they continued with the service. When it was time for preaching they gave him the chance to preach. He read the bible and began to preach. He read the bible and preached for six hours. He read the bible preached and sang.</p>
<p>It reached a point and he said that he wouldn't finish the church with us he is going far and he is going to visit another church. So you will release me to leave. They have given in the offering and they wondered what he would use for his fare back. They gave him some money for the fare. After that he preached and asked people to kneel down to pray. He prayed and the people fell down and were shaking and saying that he was a preacher. He than said that he want to go they tell him goodbye. They said that he won't go like that, they had prepared some food in the office and they said that they serve him first in order to release him early. They escorted him and they asked him to visit again. Once he had they thought he was a preacher and yet he was a thief.</p>
<p>He went to the home where he was sleeping, at the church representative house. He took a sack and took the things that were there even the clothes and kept them inside then he left with them. All the children had gone to the church and there was a boy who had remained and had gone to the farm to cut grass and God was bringing him. That preacher wanted to put the sack on his head and he asked him, "what are you carrying?" he didn't speak. That boy screamed and the people came out of the church. The church was near, they came and found that sack, he had put in clothes for that man, and woman and children and he were going with it. They wondered the preacher had turned to a thief; they took him back to the church and said that he was a thief. He was a thief and yet he cheated them that he was preaching. They punished him and snatched him the clothes and took them back to the house. They tore down his. They told him, "Go you are a thief moving around churches as you steal"</p>
<p></p>
<p>I will go to a song:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus healed the lame, the lame walked  </p>
<p>Jesus healed the dumb, the dumb spoke  </p>
<p>Jesus healed a girl, the girl of Jairo  </p>
<p>Jesus healed the lame, the lame walked  </p>
<p></p>
<p>My story has ended there.</p>
