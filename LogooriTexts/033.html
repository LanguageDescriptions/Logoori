<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Girls who wanted luck that was not theirs</p>
<p>My name is Grace Vugutsa Otieno I have a story that I want to give. In maragoli and it is about girls who wanted luck that was not theirs by force. Long time ago there were five girls and one. They grew together until the day they got married. They were beautiful, but one of them was more beautiful. One day they groomed well and went to walk on the road. They asked people who were digging the farm to comment about their beauty. They replied that they are all beautiful but one of them is more beautiful than the others.</p>
<p>When those girls heard that they took the girl and wrapped her in something, as they were walking and asked people to give a compliment and the people said that they were beautiful, but the one who was wrapped was more beautiful. When they heard that they changed her to become a dog.</p>
<p>They continued with their journey and found the boys waiting for them. And they started to pick their choice.</p>
<p>The sixth boy was not there, the dog remained alone and began to bark. On boy's mother was there and said that he will take the dog. He took the dog to go and guard the home.</p>
<p>When the son came in the evening he found the dog at home, he took the dog and began to stay with it.</p>
<p>This boy was a worker. He could worker during the day and return home in the evening. When he left home, he could leave dirty clothes and disorganized house. One day when he came home he found the clothes washed and the house was swept. He could not get anyone there but a dog, he lacked someone to consult. </p>
<p>The second day he left the house dirty together with dirty clothes. When he returned in the evening he found clean clothes, the clothes were ironed and the house was clean. It looked like someone was staying in that house. The third day the boy left for work but he was wondering what was happening in his house.</p>
<p>He left and said that he was going out for work. He arrived at the road and returned home. When he arrived home he found the skin of the dog outside. He took the skin and burnt it. When he entered the house and found a beautiful girl than others, when the girl realized that her skin had been burnt she began to cry from that point the boy knew that the girl had been putting on the dog skin to look like a dog.</p>
<p>Whenever the boy could go for work, the girl could remove the dog skin and start working in the house. When other boys started to say that the boy had married the beautiful girl, the other girls were jealousy.</p>
<p>The boy and the girl did a wedding and stayed well until death.</p>
<p>Anything that glitters is not better than all the others.</p>
