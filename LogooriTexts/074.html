<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Adulterous woman</p>
<p>Interviewer: long time ago you were doing what to adulterous women or girls?</p>
<p>Speaker: they were heavy issues. The girl was chased she could not cook from that home, when she was found doing adultery it was a big crime.</p>
<p>Interviewer: and if you see that she is heading to adultery, what were you doing to bring her back to the right track?</p>
<p>Speaker: they used to call her then they tell her that she has engaged in adultery. Long time ago they used to do adultery with brothers and neighbors. So when she did adultery with the neighbor or the brother in law they used to call her and ask her to sit down, they inform her that she has done sin and she should not repeat. Then they send her to go back to where she was born and come back with a cow. She pay the fine, then they forgives her and tells her "do not repeat again" if she refused they used to inform her because they had seen her, they have cheated and she asks them if they had seen her. When she was caught it was a very serious issue.</p>
<p>Interviewer: but you can be joking that she did that, and its true she knows that she did. But you didn't see. What did you do to discover that she had done?</p>
<p>Speaker: they used to say "they are saying you are doing adultery and you are refusing, do not move your feet someone to bring the person that she did adultery with"</p>
<p>Interviewer: and if they have done adultery and the husband sleeps with her?</p>
<p>Speaker: he dies immediately. They were not simple.</p>
<p>Interviewer: and if you slept with her and you survive?</p>
<p>Speaker: she won't do adultery again.</p>
<p>Interviewer: for example I like a husband my wife has done adultery and you have found that she has done adultery and you are doing those things, saying that you are cleansing her. She brings a cow, if I accepted how was it?</p>
<p>Speaker: the luhya people were very tough. They were terrifying the women so that they do not do adultery. They were very harsh. They were mentioning the woman if she is being adulterous and you were defending her, it was trouble and they refused and said that the woman had done adultery. And if you didn't know and you deny they used to say that is your problem and they could not force you.</p>
<p>Interviewer: Mama Jedda discipline is following the laws; you were trying to make your life. How do you see when you compare the previous days and the current ones? Are they similar or how are they?</p>
<p>Speaker: the current ones are not similar. A woman commits adultery and she comes home. When you look at it and you go and say "eh, I have seen her doing adultery" even if you say it is not possible. The current days are mixed up.</p>
<p>Interviewer: how do you see the life in the past? Where men used to marry many wives or doing adultery and he was not prevented.</p>
<p>Speaker: a man doing adultery, he does not have a limiting number. They have kept a number once you have brought a wife and you have paid dowry. It means that today you have brought that wife and you have given her a place to do farming. Even if he marries three or four women that man used to stand strong. He didn't despise the elder wife, he has the first wife, and then he goes and marries a second wife the third and the fourth wife. The first wife you are told you were the first wife and as long as he has given you a farm and a cow, you just stay in your house. And the man refuses and says that he has brought her wives. Old men used to light fire in the first wife's house. In the evening the other men come and he tells them that every wife the husband moves around that burning place, the one who is cooking well and the one who is cooking bad.</p>
<p>All the women's children he has kept them around the fireplace and each child asks to be brought the baked maize flour. Then the women brings the baked maize flour they sit and they take their children, the husband eats with the children. After eating with the children then each child goes with the pots that they use for cooking in. then he takes those wives and partition the land for them, and gives them a house. When a man had many wives he used to take them and inform all of them that when they want anything they should come and ask. And these women were not angry with the husband. And these days when a man marries another woman he forgets the others. He does not care about them. And that is the reason to why when he does that the wife refuses. Polygamy was a practice of the past. These days' things are limited, and the wives are using bad medicines. When the husband takes the medicine, he knows that the wife is great and he becomes confused and he does not think about other women. </p>
<p>Interviewer: was a woman allowed to remarry if she divorced or the husband had died?</p>
<p>Speaker: when a woman divorces her husband she does not separate with her, because the woman cannot run away if she has not seen the behaviors of the husband. She used to go and complain what the husband was doing to her, then the committee asks "how are you, this woman is seeing this?" then he says how the wife behaves and he has refused her. Then they ask him "you have finished refusing her forever" and he accepts. Even if she goes to another man he has refused her. And if the widow has lost the husband, people in the past used to see when the woman is coming home and the boys are there, and the widow as good to the clan and the family. The widow has given birth to children and the husband has died. Even if they were two or three they used to sit and say "we loved this daughter of someone then death has come and destructed her husband, she wont leave this home, she will stay here and we shall look for the brothers in law" then they look for the brother in law and they ask him to remarry her and then when she has given birth, they then ask him to marry another wife and not rely on the widow alone.</p>
<p>Interviewer: we had the customs and beliefs or the things that they were done for cleansing.</p>
<p>Speaker: yes there were medicine that were being made. Once you have buried your husband they normally say, "Go and look at this girl if she is good or she wants to finish children" then they go and look medicine for her. They used to prepare baked maize flour then they give her a plate she goes and prepare baked maize flour and she eats it alone. After she has eaten it then remains and it was their problem, they used to prepare it and give her. After she has eaten then they know that she has bad blood that they need to look medicine for her. They didn't leave her like that even today they do not leave her. Someone has to go and bath at the river very early in the morning.</p>
<p>Interviewer: now when the husband dies for example when one is still a girl, are there things that one is supposed to do or not?</p>
<p>Speaker: in maragoli these laws one should not be far, you were found that when one is told to be far, then it is another issue. Even if you had not finished staying with your wife for two years and you have paid dowry she is still your wife. But if you have not paid dowry that is when they say, you should not stand near.</p>
<p>Interviewer: but this woman, some we may have married like those of the wife they have looked around the home while you are not there. They are just there, while the others are in the village. When they burry the husband they leave with her.</p>
<p>Speaker: bothering with those issues is the problem of people because you have finished two years with him and they know well that you won't be there. Even if he has not paid dowry, and she has finished two years with her, some people normally ask one to cry all her tears because he has died while they were together. Because some people have their beliefs and others have their laws.</p>
<p>Interviewer: there are some girls who were getting married to some homesteads then they do not go well with their mother in law, if the girl begins to cook her own meals if the mother-in-law has not authorized her how was it, or if there was disagreement? </p>
<p>Speaker: long time ago you could not start cooking your own meals if your mother in law had not given you the cooking pan. She knows that you are not good with her. Because if you are with your mother in law and you've disagreed with her and yet she has not cooked her meal. Your mother in law normally tells your father in law that you are totally different. Then they ask the girl to go back to her home they give her a place for cooking in. these days they do not give cooking pans. Then she comes with a hen, maize flour and meat, while the women are waiting for her. Then her sister in law cooks for her, because the mother in law cannot cook for her if she has had quarrels with her. She normally calls her daughter to come and cook for you.</p>
<p>Interviewer: when girls were getting married long time ago they used to pay dowry, when the grooms people were coming from the bride's home how were they coming?</p>
<p>Speaker: they have paid the dowry and ready to leave. They are honored and given a pot and a cock, and hens that have been kept in the pot. The most important thing when they leave there is the two hens and the pot. The flour is just a bonus. One cock, one hen and they come with them. Then they hold the cock that the man enters with it into the house.</p>
<p>Interviewer: at the first place we had differences, those women were taking good care of themselves. But the husband was free, for the girls they were taken care of by the old women. What were girls taught by the women? Did you tell them that if they get married and their husbands marry more than one wife they should come out of the place? Did you prepare them if they will find a polygamous person or not?</p>
<p>Speaker: they used to tell us that as girls if we get married somewhere where people are polygamous, you should know that it is inheritable in people. You know if you were a girl a man used to take you even if he had another wife and you used to sleep in the mothers house. That woman used to tell us that if you get married to a husband who has another wife, you should not start complaining there. You get inside and you ask him to build you a house. Then he builds the house for you. When you go and start quarrelling with the first wife it is not good, because she is the elder wife and when the husband married another wife he said that he had married and he want to take care of the wife. And the man is the one who has the authority even if his women quarrel, he moves to all the houses until the women give birth to children until they finish. Those are the things that we were taught, we were not told to go and chase the woman that your husband has already married. They taught us that when you get married you should not dare fight your husband even if he beats you. Those are the things that people were teaching us. Even if you get a small husband, and he has given you a home where you can stay you should respect him and you should not dare to fight him. Again you should not touch his penis, if you do that you will have to pay a fine. We were taught that when we used to sleep in an old woman's house. She used to warn us from moving from one husband to another while we were still growing, you know there were girls who were teenagers that loved men, such girls could not have husbands the way our children are moving up and down. They used to sit and ask "how are you" then when the girl goes to the husband, and when the man is attracted to her, she just knows that she has broke her virginity, the blankets and the sheets are then shown to the parents that she was a virgin.</p>
<p>Interviewer: mother can I ask did you know that people who were mourning were. How do you see those days and these days? Men can be polygamous the world is spoiled. Those days were good since there was no sickness and these days there is polygamy and how is it?</p>
<p>Speaker: This day it is different, where the difference is coming from is that there is disease. If you see a husband running up and down do you think the wife will be well? These days there is less polygamy issues, if you say you love your wife then you go out and walk with monster then you come with it and say that you have married her, your wife will die, you will also die. Haven't you left the kids alone? That is the reason to why people are afraid these days. And if the world was good, one could have more women and treat them well without quarrelling. Or you hide something and take it to the other wife and you leave the other one. And then one wonders what happened.</p>
<p>Interviewer: now it is a challenge, stopping adultery, people are just doing adultery what can we do?</p>
<p>Speaker: you cannot, you remember I told you that we were getting married with 18 up to 20 years. The girl is so mature. Are you seeing the way the children are growing up? A small child knows a lot of things of the world, these days they just die because of the diseases, long time ago we didn't have diseases, when they start you here about gonorrhea, syphilis and taking a lot of medicine. Those days they used to give birth to children. Today the one that is causing people to wither (means HIV/AIDS) you will try medicine, and eat for today only?  You will have several wives? You wont manage it. </p>
<p>Interviewer: when you were taking care of these children, you used to ask questions and they answer frankly? The way she was walking or if she is walking with men? And today if you ask this question will you be given the truth?</p>
