<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Parents who perished 2</p>
<p>When this woman was condemning the neighbors they laughed at her saying that she hasn't seen it all and what she was eating is getting out of her because she had fallen her arms. Today she will know all the work and because this woman was foolish she began destroying the things that the husband had left for her. She sold all the cattle and she tricked the boy into selling the land. When she had sold she started walking bad and showing off that she had money. You should know that the child of a snake is a snake. This woman fell sick. It reached a point the sickness defeated her and she got to a point and she died. You should know that this woman doesn't have any means and people were asking the boy to provide some money that they got from selling the land but he says, "ask the one that is dead" they asked him where they too the money and people were wondering. People used to ask themselves that the husband was talking but she wasn't listening. It happened that the woman died poor without anything and the husband left her with a lot of wealth.</p>
<p>Neighbors learned something from this woman because if she could have followed what the husband was telling her she could have not died early but she was a foolish woman. And it happened that the boy who remained was a total orphan he didn't have mother or father and he was so sorrowful because he had lost the parents. Someone came to take this boy because she had mercy. When the parents died he remained alone and this person came to take him and they went to stay together. He assists her with home duties and look after her cow. This person was staying with this boy but she was treating him bad. She knew the behaviors of the mother. She used to abuse this boy and he used to cry. She used to tell him that the mother was foolish she sold the land. She could ask him to leave. The child of a snake is a snake. This boy used to listen to that and he cries and asks himself many questions. </p>
<p>He could wonder why the mother was foolish. He wished that the mother could have died and the father could have survived. If the father could have remained it could have been well but he is suffering because the mother left him on the sun. She was not a woman of wisdom. This story is teaching us that we should be clever during the time that we are staying in this world. And when a woman has remained at home she should learn to do her own things and know that teachings are very helpful they will build you in your life. </p>
<p>I also want to tell you a story. I have a story of a quail or quails.</p>
<p>Quail is a small thing. This bird is a small bird. Long time ago the quails were falling down when they have planted food like millet, wheat and maize. The time when these feed were growing up the quails were seen at most. The old men of the past used to trap the quails by making the places where they keep their quails. Know these men used to go and hunt the quails they used to make something that we call Mulage. They used to take the quails and keep them in their mulage on the tree. What used to happen is that the quails used to start to borrow while on the tree. They used to borrow like this 'throw throw throw' they were calling others to come very fast. And this man used to hide in the maize and keeps quiet. This quail used to fly and listen keenly then it comes to where other quails are and this old man has made his trap. When the quail comes from there slowly it doesn't know that they are trapping it. It goes and falls into the trap very fast. Then the man comes and removes his quail while holding it tightly because it can fly away if you don't hold it tightly. It can escape, fly and you wonder.</p>
<p>Now when these men caught the quail they used to tie a rope on the neck and the wings. And if they wanted to roast they used to break the legs when the time comes the old man used to put the quail or quails on a stick then he starts to roast them so as to remove the furs well. You should know that the quail is not slaughtered they burn it on fire and it dies. When the old man has prepared it he used to call the wife, and you know the wife has prepared her soda ash well. The woman used to sit on near the fire and begins to prepare her quail. She used to fry the quail and you should know that people in the past were not using cooking oil. The woman used to fry the quails using soda ash prepared from ash then she add salt and after cooking she removes it from the fire. She used to cover it well and the cat could not play her. She could bake maize flour while it is still time not like the way we do by cooking it at 9PM. After she has prepared her baked maize flour she now calls her husband and the children and they eat the baked maize flour and the quails. After eating their baked maize flour in the right way they drink water as they rejoice. You should know that the husband had warned his children from washing their hands with soap after eating the quail. He used to tell them, "when you eat baked maize flour and quail you should not wash your hands" he had also warned them from mixing the quail with other vegetables and they knew that. The quails have feed that they take like millet.</p>
<p>It reached a time when the old man used to remove his quails from the trap and keeps them down then he starts to feed them with the millet or wheat. This old man used to search hi farm whether he could find the ants that they used to prepare. When the old man could find the ants he used to bring his quails fast and they feed on them as they borrow. They used to call others and when they are satisfied the old man used to take them back to the trap on top of the tree because they were satisfied. In the evening he used to remove them from the trap so that they feed well. He had many traps and these quails were important and helpful to him because a quail is a small animal but very tasty. Even the bone of this quail the old man or men used to eat them and they swallow. This man saw that the quails were very important to him because he knew the importance and they used to assist him as vegetable. This bird is good to all the people and it very tasty.</p>
<p>I want to speak about two people; a clever and a foolish one.</p>
<p>A clever person when born God keeps him in his world, God gives him thoughts, eyes, ears, legs, and everything that is supposed to be on a person. God continues to keep him and expanding his ideas as he thinks of what he can do in this world and he continues and becomes a big person. As he thinks of how he can stay and does many things in his life then he begins to build on his foundation as he prays God to give him wisdom. And then he marries a wife. Then they begin to give birth to the children that God has planned for them and they expand on his lineage. Then they start to educate the children that God has given them and the children get jobs as God gives them good health. As there brains grow. Then this person knows that God has started raising his home because he was wise and action and he is not vague. Then God brings light in his home as he opens the ways and he gets wealth in fast way because God has given him good thoughts because he wasn't a stubborn person. He was listening to the words of the parents.</p>
<p>That is when God began blessing him in many ways. God has blessed him the children have received jobs and they are speaking with the ones on top. And as you pray to God because he is the one who manage everything. And wealth flows in your home like water as the mother prays for him daily to God he do great to them because this person has prayed God to give him wisdom. He gave him the wisdom. When a fool passes near your home he finds that the home is cool with vehicles, good houses and the people who are jealous begins to speak about the owner and it is God who has given you good thoughts for doing great works together with your whole lineage.</p>
<p>A foolish person is useless because the moment he is staying in the world he doesn't know anything. He wonders who made him and kept him on this world. He is just there. God has given him thoughts but he doesn't use them because he doesn't have respect. He is abusive and he argues with the parents who looked after him. He is ever complaining day and night. He is alone he doesn't even know what the world is saying. He is like he is not there. He doesn't have a way where he is heading. Everything is the same to him because he didn't listen to what the parents were saying. He is ever arguing. Even when God looks at him he wonders what he can really tell him. This person doesn't have a wife or children because his senses are bad and they are not working well. He is confused because he doesn't know anything.</p>
<p>According to the same life of a foolish person you clever person you are correct but he begins to speak bad about you as he says this, "you know you are the one owning all" this person has forgotten that God had loved him but he wasn't listening the reason is that his brain was spoiled. Then he begins to do things that a normal person cannot do in his real sense. Because when you look at a foolish person when he speaks to a person who is standing firm you find that you can not move with him because he is a fool. My story has ended there.</p>
