<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">My history (b)</p>
<p>When the Tanzanians saw that I had good behaviors they engaged me to their coalition of TANU and I was the executive. Even on the side of Trade Union they engaged me as one of the workers and I was the executive officer. Even on the side of security the police took me and I was with them, ministers used to come at my home in the evening we exchange ideas, we used to teach each other good things. And the speaker of East African Executive Assembly Herman Salawati he was so close to me and he was my best friend. Whenever we said we were coming to Kenya we used to come here and we walk together. But my lifestyle in Tanzania I changed and I said that I won't call myself a Kenyan, I call myself a Tanzanian because I had taken the culture of Tanzania and I loved it very much. Even when I stayed with the Chaga I loved them very much, because they wanted someone to be independent he buys his things and not rely on the parents things. Again the Chaga girls are so respectful they have inherited the morals of Uganda, Ugandan ladies do have respect that is good, and when you marry a Ugandan she has great respect for the husband. Again the Tanzanians and the Ugandans do not have racism again it is what is in America; they do not neglect they have good behaviors, when you are in America the Americans give you a great work the way they have given this man Obama over there. And in Kenya what I am saying is that they should change and have good morals like Tanzania, America and Uganda. If they want this nation to be well should leave the issues of negligence, they leave the issues of killing and corruption in that this one is not our own, this one will defeat me. This issue is not good in Kenya, I worked in Trade Union at Tanzania and I was speaking the issues of Tanzania, I worked well and they gave me work at East African Airways. I have stood firm at my work and I took over the work of the white man and they were not saying that I belong to Tanzania or not. I have done that work well in Tanzania as the catering manager. My first salary in Tanzania was 850. But they said that my work was excellent and of great value, and I know the good behavior they adjusted my salary to 2500 all the wealth that I am having the house, land and the clothes are from Tanzania. The morals that I have I learnt from Tanzania and I do not neglect. I work with all the people and I interact with all the people here and our ministers should learn such behaviors. We have some ministers who can sit with the citizens but when he is elected he does not want to sit with them again he wants to fly in an airplane so that he escapes these citizens. How will you know the issues of the people who have elected you when you are flying in an airplane, they have stayed permanently in Nairobi while their people are suffering. Our people should come back to us like I the historian of Kenya they come I tell them great history that they can embrace the way I was staying with Oscar Kambona as we walked like a brother. Even the brother of Oscar kambona when Oscar went to America he came and I stayed with him and Kenya should embrace that and learn from us. And the way I have said there is boy here by the name Raila Oginga this one Kenya should think about him he has suffered and the father also suffered, this child should get a chance to rule and do great things for even five years the way Nyerere ruled and he left. You do not rule forever you get to a point and God calls you or you retire and you ask the other one to take over and do that work. That thing our people of Kenya should learn and they should learn our morals. When we are in Kenya the ones that have remained are very few. Our man the retired one Daniel Arap Moi is the one who said that he is following the footsteps of Mzee Jomo Kenyetta. He followed the enmity of Jomo Kenyatta even J.M. kariuki died, Ronald Ngala died in a way that I didn't understand, again they chased after me and they wanted to kill me the way they killed Ngala, Kariuki and those people. A killing in Kenya is a shameful thing, our three people have died in Busali and they have not told us the way they died. I wonder in this Kenya the way they have brought the China do they know the China well, they took the Americans who gave them leadership. They should not create hatred with the Americans and the Europeans. Because they can rely on the China and they find that they have destroyed our work here again we have our people in America there who work there and they find that they have destroyed those things, they should not create hatred between Americans and us. Even the American like Barrack Obama was to come here but he was afraid and he didn't come, we are curious to know what has made the Americans not to come. The china have come here and they are people who are behind they never gave us independence; the Americans who gave us independence together with the Europeans have remained behind. For me as the historian of Kenya to Uhuru Kenyatta and other people I am still alive, why they don't call me to come and speak with them the way Kenyatta called me, the way Oginga called me. We want the leadership of Kenya to be peaceful. I have spoken about the things of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. I want to get back to our nation of Kenya and our maragoli or our luhya people with their culture. One thing according to the culture if you want to buy land first of all go and investigate who was living on that land, they had which behaviors or if someone was killed there? When you go to that land and you stay there if a bad thing was there it follows you and you live with problems. And when you have bought the land and you want to marry you go and ask the type of behaviors that the girl has or which house she belongs to. And the girl should also inquire where she is getting married and the behaviors that the people there have. The culture has been destroyed because you marry a woman and you do not know those things or you do not know that tribe and you get a bad name. Even when you want to employ a worker at your home in this world, you should know where the worker is coming from; you can bring a worker who is coming from far and if you do not know his behaviors he can bring people who can raid and kill you. They can come and take your property or poison you hence we should know this. And after you have given birth to a child with your wife you should ask for a good name that you can give that child. We give the children other names as if we do not have names here; our people give names and they do not know them well; you hear a child called Kamau or Karanja. And you do not know which behaviors Karanja had. When you go to the Kikuyu you cannot find them naming a child Mulinya or Adika, they call their names from home and clans. Another thing about the place where you are going to build a house you should know the person doing it should be from your house or your clan; he should not be a person who is not from your house. The way we perceive things a person from your clan is the one who shows you the place to build the house, a person of good behaviors who is not lame. One who has not killed a good person is the one who should do that. Even the initiator you should be keen and see the behaviors that he has. You can bring an initiator who does not have good behaviors or has not been circumcised or does not have a wife and you go and bring him as an initiator. The children that the initiator circumcises they do not prosper. A person who wants to do rituals and also one who goes to buy the cow should be a person from your clan, one who goes to know about the issues of the cow that is of value and does not have any issues. Again a cow that has given birth, if it is a bull it should have reproduced, with the entire ass, all the horns, with a good tail. And if it is a female it should also be like that. When a person has died the one who goes to step on the grave should be a man with good behaviors. He should not be a person who has killed and done bad things. He should be a good person. Again a person who goes to tie a cow for dowry should be a person of value, from a good family. And the cow that is taken for dowry the bull should not begin a female cow is the one that should lead, and if there is a bull it should be the third one. It should not be that the bull is the one that is leading. And if you want to go and do a ritual and you want to shave the person who should buy the razor blade should be an elder person a person who knows the razor blade and where he will go and buy. When it is bought in the evening it should not be kept in the house it should be kept outside and then you will take it in the morning when you go to shave and the person who is shaving is of which behavior? He should not be the onw who has killed, has not married, or has married a wife who has no morals, he should not be lame, he should not have a growth on the back; he should be very healthy. The person assisting the widow should be the one who has also been a widow. You should not go and look for a person who is not a widow and you say that she is assisting the widow. And a person who wants to get married to the widow should also be the one who has lost the wife and he should take water for her to the bathroom to bath. You should not dare represent or assist a widow if you are not a widow. And that thing is disturbing our people and if you want to dig a grave a woman should not be the one digging the grave, a man is the one who digs the grave. A woman should not circumcise a boy; you take our children to the hospital where they are circumcised by women and they do not know how a man is made. How does a woman circumcise a man and yet she is not a man. The issues of the bananas a woman should not be the one who goes to plant the bananas if she does then you should not go and harvest the banana. And the woman should not be the one who goes to cut that banana, you the man or if there is a good child there he should be the one who goes to cut the banana. At home when you are planting a tree it should not be the woman who is planting the tree. When a woman plants a tree she is finishing you as a man and when you want to plant a tree at home you should inquire first on the type of tree you are planting. There are trees that are bad when you plant at home they bring death fast so you should check on the type of tree that you are planting. And for the hen there were laws that a woman should not slaughter a hen, he should be a man who slaughters a cock. For the cow a woman should not slaughter a cow the culture does not allow a woman to slaughter a cow. When a woman slaughters a cow other people apart from men can eat the cow. Even if it is a goat or a sheep the laws of the culture do not allow a woman to slaughter those things. Again when the initiates have been circumcised it should not be a woman who is taking food to them or bathing them, the laws do not allow. Again where the initiates are circumcised from a woman should not walk there or meet the initiates when they're from circumcision. A barren person should not take care of the initiates; he should not pray for anyone, this is a person who has not given birth to a child. A person who does not have the body of a man should not do the work of men. For the woman there are laws that she should not eat a certain part of a hen there are laws that a man does not share the same with another man also another person should not be given that part of the hen at your house when you are there when a hen has been slaughtered that part of the hen is specifically meant for the man of the house. You should not eat it when your father is there or when your elder brother is there and you are younger, your elder brother can eat it and you eat other parts. There are things like quails; it should be a man using them. A woman should not travel in a plane when she is pregnant the child gets out. The noise of the plane causes problems. Even on the motorcycle she should not ride on it because of the shaking you can find the child has come out. Again when the woman has given birth and has not healed well when she goes on the motorcycle she finds herself bleeding very badly. A woman should not go to step on the ground where one wants to build a house. If you have your mother even if it is her who bought the land you should not go to live on that land if it is a woman who has stepped on it. A woman should not cover the house with the iron sheets and if your house has to have a pot on top of it as a sign that you married a relative it should not be done when you are not there. You should be there as a man so that the pot can be kept while you are there, the pot and covering the top of the house. It should be done when you as the man is there and the way I said a woman should not go to the forest where the initiates are staying, it is bad. We have other things in the house where we make the three stones for cooking; a man should not go there to make the stones it is done by the women. They are three stones and the things that are used to make them are coming from the wife's home. For those things they should know that it is a woman who is dealing with them. And if a person died he was not buried with the cloths or tie and the Muslims still have those good morals. That person should not be buried with the tie they should remove those things in order for that person to be buried. Even the shoes on the feet he should not be buried with the shoes or a ring on the hand. A woman should not be buried with the necklaces on the neck the laws of the culture do not allow that. A man who has been killed is not brought to the house he is just buried directly; he should not be buried at home or kept outside the house for some days. A woman who has not been paid for dowry when she dies she cannot be kept outside, they will pay dowry when they have finished her burial. They should not pay dowry when she is not buried that is wrong according to the culture. A woman who has done bad behavior or has not given birth when she has died she should not be named after. A man and a woman should not share the clothes that they put on these days you find a woman putting on the trouser that the husband puts on, a man's coat; they should not share. A woman has her things that she puts on also the husband has his own. A man who has been killed when he is brought home he should not get in through the normal gate; they make a separate temporary gate on the sides where he enters through and they burry him directly; they do not scream. They do not offer or give presents; that person has been killed and bad people who have killed that person do keep their offering inside there and then you use that money and you bring back the bad things back to that home. The issue about a person who has been killed his grave is different and it is covered differently; they reduce the soil there. When it is raining with hailstones there is s traditional way of preventing it from raining with hailstones. There are things that are done when you see the rain raining with hailstones and people do not know what to do; they should inquire from us the elders the way they prevent hailstones. Again when the thunderstorm is giving you problems at your home there are trees that we plant and the thunderstorm cannot get there; it cannot hit you, it goes there and you are safe when you want to get married to a widow that widow should have slept with another man before you get married to her. But you should not go there and you are the first person to sleep with her and also marry her. These issues are refused. A woman is like an elephant you should watch for her carefully, you can find that she has given you bad laws and you find yourself in trouble. A woman in another way the white men call her honey; a woman is honey. You take the honey and you find that it is good and you forget that maybe the woman has bad behaviors, she can give you bad disease, and she can give you another bad thing. You have to inquire the wife that you want and you walk with you know the type of behaviors that she has; she can be having disease when she has slept with another person and you find yourself in that situation. A woman is like a bee. You are staying with her but she is spying she is like the land and the soil. A woman can give you good or bad children. The way I said the land that you are going to purchase you should see if it is good; it is the same when you are going to look for a wife you should inquire about her characters if they are good and the clan that she comes from. A lot of wealth is on the woman. When you marry a good wife you will get good richness, when you marry a bad wife you should then know that the wealth is no longer on you. A woman is the house. When you have a wife you have a house, if you do not have a wife you do not have a house, you have a hat that does not have a wife. A wife is called moon. The issue of giving birth to children is the same way the moon gives birth to the stars and the man is the sun that has the stars. When the moon has gone for some days, it happens that when the star of the elder girl called Yasuli it lights as the moon is waiting. And the moon and the sun are the things that love each other. They speak their things together and they have a way that they follow like a husband and a wife. A man is also called in maragoli a sign. You as a man is a hoe or a bull that is used to dig. They say that as a man if you are not a man enough then you do not have a hoe. That hoe is the one that is causing your wife to live there. People of the past used to go to Mumia and they are given hoe and when they pay dowry they are told that their hoe is the man. It caused a woman to be asked if the husband has a hoe. When you do not play your role well at night as a man the wife waits in the morning and she asks herself what she brought herself to. A man should not be circumcised at night. There were days that the initiators used to go early in the morning to the forest to circumcise. When it is at such time the initiators have finished and they are coming back. And when the initiator has finished initiation he cannot go to sleep in his house he cannot take that blood to his house where he sleeps with the wife. And when you are being circumcised a man should not be circumcised when he is down that is a bad show when one was coward they used to circumcise him when he is down it is bad. When you are going for a journey and you meet the dead or the bad people you should go back home; you should not meet with them you can have a bad luck. When you have buried the dead you should be given something and you should not take that thing to your house, you should not go and sleep at your home because you have buried a person who has been killed. You go and look where you will sleep even in a hotel for two day and then you come out of there. And when you leave the hotel you leave when you have bathed and have kept on other clothes. Also when you leave the jail you should not go straight away to your house you go to another house and sleep there and then you will come the following day. For the woman you have heard the debate today some women are circumcising. A woman is not circumcised a man is the one who is circumcised. Why circumcise a woman? When Abraham had not been circumcised it is a woman who asked him to get circumcised. When he got circumcised they warned the woman that they should not go to circumcise a man and a woman should not be circumcised. And the man who is circumcising when he leaves circumcision place he should not go to sleep with his wife. A knife that is used for circumcision should not enter the house; it should be kept outside for the night and then it will be kept later. The bananas should not be kept on the front part of the homestead. When you plant on the front part of the house you will be finishing people and no one will survive. Bananas are planted at the back and the way I said a woman should not be the one who plants the bananas. A woman should not stand before a ritual and when a woman has committed adultery she should be clever during the husband's death she should not stand before the body. She should not handle any ritual. And the woman should be wise on the ritual for the husband death and the way I said a widow should be the one who stands with another widow. And the way I said a sign is kept on the hat by the men and you as the man of the house you should not be away. A woman is represented by the sign of a hive and the bees that stay there can sting you the women that gather around there are like the bees. If you do not have good characters the women will plot to kill you and when you get leadership a woman should not pray for you she should stay away. A woman should not hand over the culture to someone it should be a man of the traditional culture who does it. When you go to the church and you are a person who prays for people you should not go to the altar when you have done bad things at home. The way some people do they go to the altar and they have done bad things at home, he is not supposed to go to that altar when he has done bad things. When you go to cleanse a widow they do not ask where you are coming again they want one to be a man with a family. Because such men when they die they are not buried at that home they are buried at another place. That is the reason why you see when he was married to a widow they normally go back and see where he came from and how it is. If you do not have a house where you came from they have to build for you a house and they bury you they cannot bury you where you have been married to. Also the person who has died they do their ritual away from where he was married. And the teachings are of value people have to learn those teachings. The proverbs are teaching many people and that is the reason to why you see the proverbs of Solomon, Moses used the proverbs and also Jesus used the proverbs. These proverbs have good teachings when you want to grow you have to understand the meaning of these proverbs. And if you are a man who is going to be elected as a leader you should not be a leader if you have not learnt the laws because you will not sleep a day with that leadership. That is the reason to why you see Kenya has a problem because some people who did bad things have been elected, they killed people when one sees that you want to take over him he kills you and that is why you see there are many noises in Kenya. A woman should not go and pray for a man who is given leadership and when a man is looking for a wife you should go and inquire about her character and not just that you want to marry her because she is a woman. A woman is the clan, is the leader and is everything. You marry a wife who can take good care of the homestead, how will you know that the required things in the house the wife will take good care of them, what she will do, will she clean my clothes. For the children the parents should teach them while they are still young and not when they have grown; a child should know good behaviors the way the Americans and the Europeans are doing. They teach their children while they are still young. Their child grows even in Tanzania; the child is still young but she has been taught good morals. Like for the Chaga they teach the child while she is still young for her to grow when she has known the behaviors. Laziness comes from foolishness. When you are lazy it makes you to be a fool you cannot bring development at your home. You become a thief because you cannot make your own development. The way you are still a young man and you said that you want to get things for free it makes you to be a fool. Even if you marry and get children you will never do anything for the children. The children are also born with such behaviors. The laziness is coming from the foolishness that you inherited from your parents. Hard work and wisdom is richness. It is of the world that makes God to love you and give you wealth. A lot of sleep is of bad luck and it brings poverty. You should be a person who wakes up very early; you should not sleep very much. People who have buried the dead and touched the grave should not leave and eat in another home, you should not go and eat from another house, and people who bury the dead should eat in the house of the dead person because the soil has to return to the house of the dead. You should not go to another house and you say that you are going to eat from there that is the reason to why you see many people are perishing; they bury and they go to eat in another man's house meaning that they are taking the grave to that house. A dead person is going to be found in that house when you just leave and a person dies. You could not have died you get sick in one day and you find yourself dead in a day. And that is the reason to why you find many people who have not inquired about these things there is death in their neighborhood; it happens because someone bury the dead and then he leaves that home and take that grief to another house; he should not go to eat from another house because you won't sleep twice. And a woman who has committed adultery should be very careful she should not go and stand on her husband's grave when he is dead. Even when they are burying him she should leave through the back door and go away she should not be near where they are burying him. And that woman should not eat met when they are doing the ritual or they have slaughtered a cow, she should not eat that meat it will cause a lot of problems to her. She has even committed adultery and they are burying the husband and she is eating that meat. A person who is going to marry a wife should be very clever. He should know the reason to why the husband died; was he killed or he did a bad thing and you are just running there saying that you have met a husband. You go and get the issue that has happened in that house. A child who has been born by the widow if he wants you to do any activity you should be very careful about that activity. Our traditional culture was that such a child is not allowed to be a leader, he cannot succeed and he cannot pray for anyone. Such child when he wants to build a house he does not build it straight with other children; you build for him on the sides. When you allow him to build near other children he normally destroys them and they perish and the home remains empty. Such a child should build behind the home. And a person who has been killed if you do not have a place where you can bury him you go and bury him down near the river. If possible these days we have cemetery even in Kakamega where the dead are buried; he should not be buried at home and that is the reason to why you see me going to Luo land and Butsotso to teach people about those things; when a person has been killed they do that, I have to go and teach those people so that they will be well. Thank you.</p>
