<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Food that was eaten long time ago</p>
<p>My name is carolyne Chesi and I want to tell something on the food that people used to eat long time ago.</p>
<p>Long time ago when people were hungry they used to roast bananas. They didn't have enough nice. They had baked wheat flour. And they didn't mill it with machine but they were using a stone to grind it. And people were not paid money after work, because money was not there during those days. And people were eating bean leaves and they used to pluck the leaves in the evening. Then they used to add salt and water to the bean leaves. They used to cover it with banana leaves and it was cooked from a pot. Another meal was bean stew.</p>
<p>There was no cooking oil, they used to cook using soda ash then they eat it with baked maize flour. People did not have good salary. And after someone had worked for another one, he could be given banana and sweet potatoes, these are the things that they were given as payment because there was no money. They advanced to a coin, and then a fifty cent and they moved on like that. These people didn't have clothes they were putting on a small skin for covering the private part alone.</p>
<p>And if you wanted to know that this person is earning something, you could check it from the cloth, there were clothes that came and they were called "marikaano" if you saw someone putting on that cloth you could know that this person has been remembered by God because people didn't have clothes. When someone delivered a child she used to cover the child with that cloth.</p>
<p>She used to take the child and cover her with that cloth. Even if the child went for a long call on her she could wipe the faeces and carry her in that cloth. These people were very happy since thy got those cloths that is what they used to cover their children with, because they didn't have towels.</p>
<p>That is what I wanted to tell you about the meals that people used to take long time ago.</p>
<p>I have a story. </p>
<p>IT IS A STORY OF HARE AND CHAMELION</p>
<p>Long time ago hare met chameleon and asked him "You are walking very slow, will you reach where you are going?" the chameleon told him "why are you looking down upon me? Do you want us to compete?" the hare laughed and said, "If I compete with you I can leave you a long range of distance." They stopped arguing and they agreed to compete running. The chameleon agreed to start the completion. The chameleon climbed on the tail of the hare and when the whistle was blown, the hare ran very fast and the chameleon was on his back, when the hare reached where they had agreed to meet with the chameleon he looked behind and didn't see the chameleon. The chameleon climbed down from the tail and while the hare was looking behind to see if the chameleon will arrive, the chameleon was already down and he told hare "I am here" the hare was shameful, that is the first story.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>THE SECOND ONE IS ABOUT EVELIA AND HIS BIRD</p>
<p>Evelia was a very clever boy. He used to go and weed their farm of maize. When he arrived there he saw the bird eating maize. He tried to catch it but it flew to the tree that was near. Evelia went home and thought of what he could do. He thought it was wise for him to use a trap; he made his trap and kept it in his hand. When dawn came he returned to their farm, he tied the trap on the maize that the bird was eating and then he went to sit under a tree. When the bird went to eat the maize, the beak stuck on the trap that was made of glue. Evelia went and took the bird, he was jubilant and he jumped up and down. That story has ended there. </p>
<p></p>
<p>HARE AND LION</p>
<p>Long time ago there was a lion that went to the forest to look for food but he didn't find any animal to kill. In evening he thought of returning back home. When he was returning home he saw a place to hide and he went to hide in so that when an animal comes he can catch it. Hare came and reached at the door. He saw the footsteps of the lion; he sensed that the lion seems to have entered into the hiding place. The hare though and asked himself how will he know the truth. He stood outside and said "Hello my house." When the lion heard he said "hello" when the hare heard he ran very fast. The lion followed him but he didn't catch him. That story has ended there.</p>
<p>MUHONJA AND THE OGRE</p>
<p>Long time ago there were two children who were orphans. The boy was called Agurakiraka and the girl was called Muhonja. Their father left for them six cows in the village that they were staying in there were many ogres. When Agurakiraka went to look after the cows, Muhonja could close herself inside the house and wait until his brother comes. The brother used to sing this song in order for the sister to open the door. This song was used to go like this:</p>
<p>Muhonja *2</p>
<p>Our Muhonja, Muhonja</p>
<p>I am from grazing the cows, Muhonja,</p>
<p>All the fields for grazing, Muhonja,</p>
<p>Are for sheep, Muhonja,</p>
<p>Coming out with spears, Muhonja,</p>
<p>To protect ourselves against our enemies, Muhonja.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ogre used to hear and try to imitate the way he was singing, the ogre used to go at the door after Agurakiraka has gone to graze the cows then it starts to sing:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Muhonja *2</p>
<p>Our Muhonja, Muhonja</p>
<p>I am from grazing the cows, Muhonja,</p>
<p>All the fields for grazing, Muhonja,</p>
<p>Are for sheep, Muhonja,</p>
<p>Coming out with spears, Muhonja,</p>
<p>To protect ourselves against our enemies, Muhonja.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Muhonja opened the door thinking that it was his brother and yet it was the ogre, Muhonja opened the door and the ogre swallowed her. When Agurakiraka came he found the ogre and cut it stomach and Muhonja came out alive. </p>
<p>It was joy.</p>
<p>My stories have ended there.</p>
