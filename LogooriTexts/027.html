<p>I have a maragooli story; it is about an animal called hare. Hare is known because of its tricky ways. On the other side it's known to be clever than other animals. One day the hare was so hungry. And it figured ways of getting meals. He walked and reached somewhere, and saw a tree that had many fruits. When he looked at the tree he realized that he could not climb on it. He thought for a while and realized that if he wanted the fruits to come down he needed to look another animal to shake the tree or the one that climb on it in order for me to get the fruit. He went and found a cow that was grazing. He greeted the cow and asked her how she was, and the co told him that she was looking for meals. The hare told her that he had passed a place and seen some food. Food that we can eat and get fed. So I want you to follow me, and assist me to get the food. The cow asked him where the food was, the hare told her that they were fruits on the tree. The cow told him that she was on that tree.</p>
<p>The hare told her that she could not manage to climb the tree and what she needed to do is to move back and hit the tree with a lot of force. The fruits that are on the top will fall down then we eat. The cow did not think about, she believed that the hare was telling her the truth. She moved back and came with a lot of momentum, and hit the tree with the head. Though the fruits fell down, the hare was not interested in the fruits; he wanted the milk from the cow. When the cow hit the tree the horn stuck inside. Since the cow knew that hare was her friend she began screaming, she expected the hare to assist her to get off from the tree.</p>
<p>The hare ran away very fast since he knew what he wanted, he went home and called his children and wife, and they came with buckets. They wanted to get what they needed from the cow. And they wanted the milk from the cow. The hare began to milk the cow. Because he knew that there was no other day of finding the cow and milking her. He milked the cow and poured the milk in the bucket and asked his children to come and suck the milk. They carried the milk home. Hare used the cow in a wrong way. This story is teaching us that even if you have a friend, you should know that you have a friend of this type. There are some friends who may want to take things from you, and they look for a way of doing it. Then they come and take it away from you. We need to learn that before you get a friend you need to know the kind of friendship.</p>
