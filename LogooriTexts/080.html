Na mugera gwene yigwo gwali munene vamvuka ku virenge dave vagenda mmatsi dave vatsila ku liato. Ku lwa vatsitsa mu l;iato ma vahilwa engereka ma vatsia kokola igasi; iduka jioni kandi vatsa ku liato vambukitswa vagaluka wa vatuli. Vakolanga ndio lelo liali ho lidiku lindi lilala ni vatsia vammbuka vatsia wa vqayinzilanga. Vayinzila igasi yavo ni vamala. Ni vakamala vatevana kutsi kolomba ku mitwi; malwa gali ho ga kale, niva yali chang'a, busa; gali ho tsa. Vatsia valomba mitwi jiavo galoleka valevi chakali. Lwa vatsa ni isaa yakavita; mundu wi liato amaliyi igasi atsiyi yengo. na yatsitsa yengo yavugula liato lielie avoha ku kisala ha amanye asamuli asubui ma oyo atsia.

<p>We had two men. These two men were masons. They used to leave where they were staying and they go to build river. And that river was long, they didn't cross the river on feet they were using a boat. They were using the boat and they could cross to the other side to go and work there. In the evening they could come back and cross the river using the boat and get back to where they were coming from. They used to do that, now one day they went to work where they normally work and they did their work and finished it. After that they asked one another to go and prepare beer. There was beer that was prepared in the past, which was "chang'aa and busaa"</p>
<p>They went and got drunk; when they came it was late the person who offers the boat services had finished his work gone home. When he finished he tied his boat on a tree, where he knew that he would find it in the morning. When they came they said "wa! This person is not in here? We have hands let us get in sail home" they climbed on the boat and started to sail, since they were drunk, they saw like the boat was moving back where they were it was.</p>
<p>They rotated at the same place the whole night but they thought that they were going home. In the morning the owner came and found people on that boat then he asked them what was there problem. They said, "we wanted to get on this boat and go home, but we are not seeing it moving and we are wondering how it is." He told them that someone's work belongs to that person. So he went and untied the boat then he took them where they wanted. Thank you.</p>
