<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">The woman who was digging far</p>
<p>There was a woman and this woman had her children. This woman wanted a house helper because she had a small child. She was doing farming from a far place. She used to leave with her children and they go to farm and leave the small child with the house helper at home. She could instruct the house helper to clean the clothes and cook. When we see it is coming to rain we will come back to eat and there was an ogre that was sick. It was neighboring their home. This ogre could wait when the woman has left, whenever this woman left the ogre could come.</p>
<p>The girl had not prepared the meal, she had not even added firewood to the fire, and gone to the river to fetch water and even clean the clothes. This ogre could start:</p>
<p>Scratch me, scratch me</p>
<p>The girl could start to sing:</p>
<p>I scratch you, I scratch you while the mother's child cries, the food is getting burnt</p>
<p>Rain come fast, rain come fast</p>
<p>For those who went to the farm to come back x2</p>
<p>And the ogre says: Scratch me, scratch me</p>
<p>The woman could arrive and find that the food is burnt and the girl has done nothing. She could punish the worker. The girl told her that there is an ogre that normally comes around and request her to scratch it. It was the one that caused her to delay in cooking. The woman said that she will look for it and she will find it. The second day it came; the woman pilled the food and put on fire. She left work for the house helper and asked her to go to the river and fetch water, then clean the child and cook food. She took her four children and they went to the farm. When she had put the food on fire the ogre came and started:</p>
<p>Scratch me, scratch me</p>
<p>The girl could start to sing:</p>
<p>I scratch you, I scratch you while the mother's child cries, the food is getting burnt</p>
<p>Rain come fast, rain come fast</p>
<p>For those who went to the farm to come back x2</p>
<p>When the woman came back she found that the food was burnt, and the house helper had done nothing. The third day the woman promised to leave for work but she didn't arrive where she was going. She hides herself and she had assigned the house helper her normal duties. When they arrived at the road the ogre came as usual and found the girl and it started to sing:</p>
<p>Scratch me, scratch me</p>
<p>The girl could start to sing:</p>
<p>I scratch you, I scratch you while the mother's child cries, the food is getting burnt</p>
<p>Rain come fast, rain come fast</p>
<p>For those who went to the farm to come back x2</p>
<p>This woman came and found the ogre was there, she called other people and she killed this ogre. My story has ended there.</p>
