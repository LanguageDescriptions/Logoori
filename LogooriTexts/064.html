<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Ayuma and witchcraft</p>
<p>She was called Ayuma. Where Ayuma was coming from they were witch. They were people who were running outside at night. When she came to his husband she started to teach her "you should know where I am coming from, we are people who are jumping out at night, today I want to teach you how to jump outside." The husband asked her "what they are telling me, will I manage it? In our village we do not jump outside at night, what is my wife telling me" the husband wondered.  He spoke to his heart saying that he will share that with the people. The day passed and the husband didn't listen to the issues of Ayuma. The following day Ayuma returned and told him "I had told you the things" the husband agreed that she had told her the things but he does not agree with that, because it was something that he had not done. The second day ended like that.</p>
<p>The third time Ayuma told her whether she likes it or not he has to go and witch outside. "Today I will give you the cheetah that I came with from home you go and run with it outside" the husband asked her "when I run with the cheetah outside people will find me" Ayuma replied "they wont find you I will teach you how to do it" she taught him that he should go while she remains at the cooking place. "I want to take my feet and step on the fire place and you go as you sing" she told him.</p>
<p>It is ours *3</p>
<p>That we were given</p>
<p>While I am stepping at the fire that man could reach somewhere and he fears, and says "I have never done this." He reached to a point and thought and then said, "Ayuma has brought witchcraft in our home and we are not people who do witchcraft. I want to share this with the luhya they come to witness it for me when that man said that he began to sing a song saying:</p>
<p>Ayuma please what are you telling me</p>
<p>Yeee, yeeee</p>
<p>And Ayuma replied:</p>
<p>Yeee, eeeeee, </p>
<p>My husband please move on, move on, I am stepping on the cooking stone</p>
<p>The husband listened to the song then he said "how is the song sang?" then Ayuma returns to the husband and says "ai! I will tell people" the husband begins to sing:</p>
<p>Women please bring Ayuma a cheetah</p>
<p>Aa oh Ayuma please wait for all the neighbors to sleep</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ayuma listen what is he saying? Then the husband continues to sing</p>
<p>I will talk with who Ayuma*2</p>
<p>You have brought witchcraft</p>
<p>I am jumping out in cold mother at the doors awoiyeee</p>
<p>Yeee, aaaaa, awoiyeee</p>
<p>Yeee aaaa vayayi woiyee</p>
<p>A wife with witchcraft</p>
<p>It ends there.</p>
