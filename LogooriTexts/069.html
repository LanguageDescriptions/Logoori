<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">How to milk a cow</p>
<p>My name is Carolyne Chesi and I am going to milk a cow.</p>
<p>When a cow gives birth you should take good care of it. The way we graze it and giving it required food. You should treat the cow well. You give it water at the right time. You add salt to the water and there are some meals that you give a cow that you are milking to increase the quality and the quantity of milk. After giving it water you give it nappier grass. After giving it grass you take it to a place where it rests until the time of milking. After that you take it to a place where you milk it from and you ensure before you milk the cow it is well fed. When it has milk and needs to be milked you will hear it mowing. </p>
<p>You take the cow to a cow shade or a place where you normally milk it from. And that place should be clean. Then you warm your water and you keep the calf near. There are some that you warm the water then you wash the udder and you start to milk while others you allow the calf to start sucking the milk before you milk it. When you wash the udder if it a cow that you do not have to give it the calf first, you just wash the udder and you dry it with a dry clean cloth and the tools for milking should be clean.</p>
<p>You clean the udder then you start to milk your cow, and if you are using the calf to suck the milk then you clean the udder and then you allow the calf to suck the milk for some two minutes, then you clean your hands and you start to milk the cow. After finishing milking the cow, you take it out. You give it nappier grass so that when you will be able to milk it on the following day I the morning. </p>
<p>Once you have finished you go and get the number of cups from the milk that you have milked. If there are people who normally take in the evening you will give them. When morning comes you warm the water. You clean the udder then you apply milking oil and you start to milk. And if you use the calf then you wash and allow the calf to suck the milk first before you start to milk. After a few minutes you take the calf away and you start to milk your cow. You weigh your milk and you know the amount of litres that you get in the evening and also in the morning. Then you put all your litres together.</p>
<p>After you have put them together, you now know the amount of cash that you receive in the evening and in the morning from the milk sells. You put the money together then at the end of the month you count the entire amount and it helps you to educate and feed children. If you have your cow you cannot have problems to educate your children. To save and also feed you children. And you ensure that you are feeding your cow well and also treating it. If you just keep the cow there without taking care of it and you expect these things you won't be able to manage it. People will be looking at it and say that you have a cow but you do not know how to take care of it. </p>
<p>That is what I had prepared for you today on how to milk a cow.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I HAVE A PERSONAL STORY</p>
<p>I personally did not know how I grew up. I started to know when I joined nursery. When my mother took me to a nursery school I studied there for one year. Then I joined class one. Then I continued with my studies well. When I reached class three, I was stubborn.I could reach at school and find that children have already entered the classroom, I could not get in. I could go to hide. I could wait when children are going back home then I could be the first one to arrive home. Whenever my mother could ask me that we have come from school I could say yes. I could find that she has prepared lunch and it was ready.</p>
<p>I could eat the food then I get out with the aim of going back to school. And when I arrive where I was hiding in the morning I could hide there. I could wait when the children are going back home and snatch one of the students his book together with what he has, then I copy it on my book and mark for myself. And when I arrived home, my mother could want to check on my books but I could tell her that we had collected the books. After a week she asked me, that why are we always collecting all the books? I could say it is like that. One day she asked me to come with books; I took the books and went with them back home. </p>
<p>When she checked them she told me that the one that had ticked the books was not a teacher. I took her as a fool since she had not gone to school but she realized my trick. She took a stick and punished me. And promised to take me to school the following day in order to find out where I hide. The following morning she took me to school. She took the books and gave the teacher. The teacher took stick and punished me. She told me that from that I will not be going for lunch and I should be the first one to arrive home. And she asked me to be signing a certain book before I get inside the classroom. I saw that this teacher was telling me nothing and I continued to be stubborn.  </p>
<p>It reached a point and got a disease called foot athlete. That is when I avoided going to school because I was afraid that my fellow students will laugh at me. Whenever students could go for break I could not attend it. I used to fear that when I go outside the students will laugh at me. They bought for me medicine and I applied it on my feet, I got healed and I started schooling well because of the punishment, when they punished me that is when I started to my education. I resumed my education and became a clever child. I went on up to class eight.  </p>
<p>I did my final examination at class eight, and since my father was staying at home, he was financially unstable, I stayed at home. And as usual whenever a girl had finished class eight she used to stay at home and some people could ask her to get married. And others could ask her to find a job. I realized that I was a small girl who was not able to handle marriage. I went to work. I saw my siblings were still small and my father was financially unstable. I started working from Kisumu then I moved to Nairobi.</p>
<p>And the little that I got I used to send it home to my parents so that they assist my siblings. And the little that I got I used to buy clothes. And when I saw someone who was going home, I could give him and ask him to take it to my siblings. When I left Nairobi, my father got a job, and I left the work that I was doing, as a house help. I got married. When I got my house, God blessed me with children. What thing that I remember is that I disturbed my parents and I normally pray God to take care of my children so that they receive good education.</p>
<p>I prayed God to give my children wisdom so that they should not be like me. And my children are receiving their education because if you get married without education then you are nothing. Or if you have no education someone can send you somewhere and ask you to read something on the board and you get lost, these day English is the language that is commonly used. And when you are taken to a police station you may fail to answer the questions. </p>
<p>That is what I had prepared for you on personal story.</p>

<p>I HAVE A SONG WITH A STORY:</p>
<p>Stories were meant to entertain young children and also give them teachings after eating supper. The girls used to gather around their grandmother and the boys used to gather around their grandfather. After telling ogre stories they could sing lullaby songs. And one of the lullabies was like this: </p>
<p>I am tapping my laps,</p>
<p>I am tapping the laps with sack</p>
<p>It's a sack of heart that is picking itself</p>
<p>It is picking itself on water</p>
<p>I am stopping water like a stomach that has matured</p>
<p>It matured and stuck on the back</p>
<p>On the back mother its heartburn</p>
<p>We are hitting it slowly</p>
<p>The one that is slow is for a spinster that doesn't hear</p>
<p>If the spinster does not hear things have moved down</p>
<p>Mother what has gone there they pay for it</p>
<p>They pay with the baked maize flour for tomorrow</p>
<p>Go and ask the girl who is grinding the maize</p>
<p>Tsiriririri even a woman ahu!</p>
<p>Another one is for Ndiegu who went to look for food:</p>
<p>Ndiegu went to look for food</p>
<p>And denied the child</p>
<p>And the child went to look for food</p>
<p>And denied Ndiegu</p>
<p>Ndiegu vaava, why are you crying</p>
<p>Tsunu tsunu tsunu tsunu.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I have ended there.</p>
<p></p>
