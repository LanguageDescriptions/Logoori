<p>Gaduchi yaho na nyasaye amugasitse.</p>
<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">A man who married a second wife</p>
<p>I am Linet Mmbone and am staying at Jidereri. Today I am going to tell you a story about a man who married a first wife, who died then he married a second wife.</p>
<p>We had a man who had a wife but she died then he married a second wife. She had a girl and this man had a girl also. So when he married this woman who had a girl, she met this man with her daughter in his home. They started their life, together with both their children. This woman began to neglect the daughter of the woman who had died. She did not like her. This woman began her behaviour, she used to leave her child in the bed but she will wake up the other one very early in the morning, to go to the river. After fetching water from the river, she could ask her to light the fire. After lighting the fire she could ask her to cook the tea, before that she could be asked to clean the place where the animals were sleeping.</p>
<p>And you should know that she was supposed to go to school. Her daughter could take tea first and then she goes to school. By the time this girl was reaching at school it was very late at nine in the morning. She could go there without even bathing. She could put on the uniform, inside out. She had a lot of tasks to do, until she even forgot to take tea that she had prepared. It came out clear that this child was not performing well at school because of the stress. At lunch time when she came home for lunch she could find, buckets that were to be filled with water outside. And when she gets there, she could pick the buckets and run to the river to fetch water. When she comes from the river to take lunch, the mother could give her while she was shouting at her. And the other child never touched anything. She was loved by the mother, and she was not doing anything. She could sit with her mother whenever she left school, and they could make the other girl to cry because they were laughing at her. </p>
<p>She has forgotten that she is a girl like her. This mother didn't want her girl to do anything. And if the daughter that belonged to the father punished the other girl, she could find herself in trouble because the girl was loved by the mother. Whenever she went to the market she could buy bananas and when she returned home she could start complaining, and this was a way of denying the other girl, what she had brought from the market. She could buy cloth for her daughter, but she could not buy for the other girl. They continued with that life, and the mother continued to frighten and make fun of this girl. One day the husband came from work to the place where they were staying. He brought a lot of things to his children and wife. What happened is that this woman denied the girl bread.</p>
<p>This child began to cry. When the husband heard her crying, he called her and asked her what was happening. The girl told him that she has been having problems where she is staying. The mother has denied her bread. This child was sad. The father asked her questions. He became angry and asked himself why was the woman treating his daughter like that. He told his wife " I never knew, from today I am fed up with your behaviours. Take your things and your girl and leave. Let me suffer with my daughter." This story is teaching us that, if you get married to a new home you should love the children who are there and also bring them together and God will add you more.</p>
<p>I also want to tell you a story about a woman and a man </p>
<p>There was a time, a man and his wife were going to hunt scopion and grasshoppers. They were going during the daytime when it sunny. They could begin their journey to where they were hunting the grasshoppers. They were walking with a basket for keeping in what they hunted. So when they were hunting, they ran very fast and the man got the scopions up on the tree. </p>
<p>He climbed on the tree and he began to hunt them. And because he was hungry he began to eat them. When the woman saw that she continued to hunt her grasshoppers. The woman told the husband to hurry up they were to leave the place. In a few seconds while the husband was still up on the tree, an ogre came and it caught the woman. The woman screamed very loudly. And because this man had problems with his ears, he didn't hear what was happening. After he had finished eating he went down very fast but he didn't see his wife.he started looking for his wife. He called "my wife!" but the wife was no where to be seen.</p>
<p>He called the second time but his wife was not responding back. The man became worried. He started to speak to himself and he lacked someone to answer. Where has the woman gone? He began to search in the forest but he didn't see the wife. He thought maybe the wife has gone home. He reached at a point and he was tired, he asked himself what he could do. It seems like my wife has been eaten by monsters in the forest, after resting for a while he returned where he was coming from and he thought maybe the wife had lost the way. He moved to the other side of the forest and he began to call his wife "my wife! My wife!" he called the wife and when he got near the river the frogs began to reply to him "Twi twi twi." The man was astonished. He asked the frogs why they were immitating him whenever he called the wife. He became annoyed and he began to throw stones at the frogs. The frogs got into the water and they began to immitate the man. This man asked himself many questions. He continued with his work and when he got to a place he began calling his wife, "my wife! My wife!" the bird heard it and they started responding to him "Chwi! Chwi! Chwi!" he looked at the tree and when he threw a stone, the bird flew away. The man continued with his journey. He walked and reached near the ogres and he began to call his wife. The ogres asked him, "you left your wife to who?" when the man turned around the ogres ran away and hide in the ditch. He was nervous, and he didn't have energy. He returned to his home thinking what to do. He was sorrowful. He started regretting why he asked his wife to go to the forest together. If he could have left his wife, he could have not lost. Since his wife was lost, he took his sheep to the elders to pray so that he could find his wife. In the morning he took his sheep ready to give to the elders as they had agreed. When he untied it the sheep began asking him "where are you taking me? I am not the one who lost your wife" the sheep began to run very fast. This man thought of what he could tell the elder men that were to receive the sheep. What happened is that the man began screaming. He aksed himself what to do, he regretted why he went to hunt together with the wife, and unfortunately the wife got lost. This story is teaching us that we should be clever in everything that we are doing, we should not be foolish. Be it father or mother, you should have wisdom; let god grant us wisdom at length.</p>
<p>I want to tell you about the first child, the second child and the third child.</p>
<p>The time when the man married this woman they loved each other, because the blood blended and they began to stay together, they prayed to God because he is the one who brought them together to stay in peace. When they continued to stay together, God gave them a baby boy. The time when they got this child they were very happy the reason is because, he was their pride. They were very happy and they praised God. The father and the mother continued to love this child. They took good care of this child and he began to walk. This child began to knew his father and mother. These parents began to love this child the way they were supposed and they placed their hands on him. The father didn't want anything to fall on his child because he was the first child. The mother didn't want to hear her child cry. They treated their child with extra care like an egg. For that reason they didn't want anything to touch their child. They were preparing for him different types of meals everyday. They also thougt of organizing a big party for their child. </p>
<p>They invited guests because he was the first child. This child received a lot of presents. The parents were very happy and they said that a child is important in life. It reached a point and the father and the mother began asking themselves a lot of questions. The father asked the wife "who do you think this child ressembles?" the mother laughed loudly. The husband replied to her "the first child should look like the father, because the firstborn child is a sign that the father is a real man because if you give birth to your own child people fear you for that reason people who are seen are the parents of someone. It looks like these are the parents of someone and they are very happy"  it reached a time the father told his wife "God has given us a baby boy, we are grateful and the work of this child is to look after the cows. And cleaning the home the way it is supposed to be done, to weed the trees and the flowers" to do good things because the child was obedient to his parents and god taught him.</p>
<p>Now they thought of how they could get a second child in the house. The father and the mother continued loving each other together in the house together with the child that God had given them. They asked God to give them another child. One day od answered them and this woman became pregnant for the second time. She started showing that she was pregnant for the second time. She told her husband that God loves her, he laughed and kept quiet. There came a time and the wife told him that she is pregnant again. When the husband heard that he was very happy. He appreciated his wife and told her to believe in God who made them because he is the one who made everything. For that reason we should continue to ask everything from God and we leave a happy life as we pray God who made us.</p>
<p>One day God gave this woman a second child, and the child was a girl. At the moment when this woman got the child she thanked God, she knew that the father was not near. When he heard the information he was pleased but he was not very happy. The wife asked him why he didn't have the joy that he had when they got their fast child. She became angry and she asked herself that "God is the one who makes everything and for that reason every child is a child" God has given you the first child and the second the child. All the children are yours and you should not despise any of your children because you are the parents of all the children. Even if you like the firstborn you should not show the other children that you love the firstborn child alone. You are planting something bad in them. You should not separate your children, you should present them to God and he will give you the wisdom of taking good care of them in their life. These children will live with respect in their entire life.</p>
<p>I have a story about a woman and his son who were staying together.</p>
<p>Long time ago there was a woman who gave birth to her child who was a boy but he didn't know his home. This woman began to stay with his child the way a parent stays with the child because God is the one who gave him the child. For that reason the mother had to take good care of the child. One day this woman went to look for food and the place where she was going was far so she walked very fast and she reached the place. The child didn't have great knowledge, the woman used to leave the child alone at home. When she came home she could find the child was no there. This woman began to look for her child because everytime she left home, when she came back she didn't find her child at home. When it was at night the woman became worried because the child was lost. This woman didn't cook anything. She became sorrowful because her child was lost. In the morning the woman began to scream. People came to her home and asked her what had happened. They encouraged this woman and she left everything to God who had given her this child.</p>
<p>The following morning when this woman woke up she began her work and she began to sing and she sang like this:</p>
<p>My only one child</p>
<p>Eeee</p>
<p>My only one child</p>
<p>My only one child</p>
<p>Eeee</p>
<p>My only one child</p>
<p>This woman was singing as she cried whenever she imagned of her son everytime. She used to go out for work to look for food because if she stays at home what will she eat. She walked as she watch all over, so that she can see her son. She slept for five days. She wanted to leave home, she saw a girl coming, from the gate. She was astonished and she asked "You girl, who are you that I have forgotten?" the girl replied "I have been sent here to your home." The woman asked her "You have been sent here by who?" the girl replied to her "I was walking on the road and I met a boy and he told me that his mother has a lot of problems, she does not have someone to leave at home and also to assist her" this girl began to pick litter on the compound and began to do cleanliness in that home. When she had finished she called the woman to come and see the visitor. She left what she was cooking and she came to see only to realize that it was the girl. The woman laughed and she asked the girl where the visitor was. She answered her that she won't see her again. The girl told the woman that from that day she should know that the son is lost and whenever she sees her, she should know that she has seen her son. "Your son has gone to look for food and he is nearing to come home." One day in the morning the woman saw her son who had lost entering through the gate. When she lifted her eyes and saw him she ran to him and rejoiced and she said "God you still love me, through all that I went through you have given me mercies, God knows me."</p>
<p>I have reached there and may God bless you.</p>
