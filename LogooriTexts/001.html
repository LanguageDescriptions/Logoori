<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">History of Maragoli</p>
<p>I am Henry Nyareso Munangwe. I am a Maragooli and according to his lifestyle. He originated from Egypt. They came along the Nile River. They came and stayed at congo forest. Then they came to Uganda. They came to lake victoria. They climbed on boat and came to land at south nyanza. When they arrived there they met the Kisii, they came with the Nyore up to Maseno, the Nyore went on his own and the maragoli remained at the hills. The maragooli went to make his living in the open land. </p>
<p></p>
<p>While they were staying there they gave birth to children. He had different way of living. And taking care of the house and the farm. Those children were growing up. The first child belonged to a clan called mutari, mukizungu, ekirimo. Then Mmavi. They migrated to North Maragoli. Mukuzingu clan was at the middle. Mukirima was at the front side of the Mmavi. He remained home. He had other children. Some of the sub-tribes in maragooli are as a result of him giving birth to children outside. His tribe grew as a result of giving birth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He was a person who wanted a big land because he found a place for digging and concentrated there. He concentrated there on farming with other children. They did not want a big land because they will not manage. He was taking care of the home, children and good life. Valogooli migrated to different parts of Kenya. He is all over the place. The government made us to reach here in Tiriki as Valogooli. When the boy was grown up, he was initiated. He informed his children about the bad things and warned them, he taught them good morals. And the old woman used to stay with the girls. And the way of cooking food.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Getting water. To plant vegetables. So that when she get married she will have good morals. Because if she lacked morals she was chased and asked to go and learn good morals. He had different way of living. Boys were grazing cattle. They dug together and cooked food. He got this language from their blood. Even Kisii share some maragoli words. We found Swahili that was spoken by people from Mombasa. We now speak Swahili. The Whiteman introduced English. Few people received Education. And they lived with the Whiteman while the other Maragoli thought that the Whiteman will grab land from them. Or they had a different lifestyle that could break the African way of life. They stayed away from the Whiteman. </p>
<p></p>
<p>They had a religious life showing that it was God who sent the disciples to spread the gospel. They knew Christ and they went on a hill to pray. They did not do wrong things. When it was sunset they could go to pray. They watched the clouds the way they were moving. As they do their work the way the sun is on. Then they pray. And God brought rain. Valogooli had their way of life. It is about knowing God's ways. They made three stones and prayed. As they ask for rain to come. They prayed together and they were accustomed to different way of life. </p>
<p>Because when someone is in the house you do not know the way he/she is living with his/her children. Maragooli used to teach his morals and it was reflected in his children even when they went away. And the greatest thing was respect. His life was on building good things. And good morals, bad things had their own stories reflecting evil. If you were a person who was not trustworthy he had a story that he told his children together, that when if they steal from their parents or steal food or vegetable and they do not know who did that, he could take these children to the river and ask them to cross the river if they have not stolen and whoever falls will be known as the one who stole. The one who stole whenever he/she could try to cross he could fall inside and die.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It teaches that it is not good to do wrong, in life. It also made one who want's to do evil to shun away from it. His life was to do good things. He stayed together with people. They had Naandi as their neighboring community that was actively involved in war. But a Maragooli was not interested in war. But when he saw that they were persisting with war, he started making his arsenal for war, spears and swords for fighting enemies. Since they had large pieces of land the Maragooli began fighting them as they push them away and take land. But they did not have problems with the other luhya tribes. We have several sub-tribes in luhya. When it was time for initiation, one had to go through initiation. Some could hide until they get old but when it was time for initiation they could get hold of this person.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was a shame when they were circumcised and people could sing about them. That was our way of life as we celebrate things like these. I believe I will live for the old man, who knows more than me. We had diseases on this world. We also had herbs that we were using. Some knew that Malaria had herbal medicine. If you take malaria goes away. And you feel better. Before the doctors came in. he had several ways of surviving even when sickness came in. they could slaughter a goat after praying, they could bless the child and the child could grow well. They knew their life will be good. They had good morals and they brought us up.</p>
