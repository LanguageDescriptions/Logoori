<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">The way God made the world</p>
<p>I am Henry Nyareso Munangwe and we are staying here in Jidereri and I want to talk on how God made the world. How the world came to be. We are speaking from Maragoli and in general the question is number two. How the world came into existence and the thoughts of our grandfathers. They used to tell their children and grandchildren. The way the world was and the way it is. The way these children were to live and the way they were to take care of themselves in this world of many things and traps. Their grandfathers used to tell them that there were many forests that were big and also many lakes. In these forests there were ogres and many birds. Animals were staying in this forest and were compared to elephants and gazelles, rhinos and giraffes. There were big snakes that were in these forests that could swallow a goat. The animals that were staying in water or in lakes were compared to the size of a crocodile and big sharks that can swallow a person very fast. Our grandfather used to say there were swamps, forests and lakes. People were staying along this swamp. There were small rivers that were flowing into these lakes and the ogres and other animals were moving along those rivers until they get to where people are staying. These people were killed by these animals at first. Every time they were killed by these animals but they sat down and thought of what they could do, since these ogres and animals were their enemies.</p>
<p>They discovered that when they light up fire at night these animals were staying away. And during the day the old men thought until they came up with sharp objects, spears, knives. They made bows and the spears and arrows in large quantity. They also realized that when a snake bites someone that person was not healing. They discovered that the snakes had a bad poison. They were killing a snake and then they put in their arrows and spears for hunting animals in the forest. Whenever they pierced these animals they were dying. They were doing that in their life. They were doing that in their whole life. These grandfathers used to say that their God whom they were praying to was doing wonders these animals reduced and the water in the lakes reduced. When people were lighting up fire the forests were reducing the way they are reduced. And people because of praying to God the blessings of giving birth, they added and they prayed in the world and they build in it the way they are. Our grandfathers emphasized praying in the morning while looking at the east and if it a day of blessing God to remember them. They were also praying in the evening so that God protects them at night and they were praying while facing in the west. </p>
<p>The way the land of Maragoli is:</p>
<p>The land of Maragoli is small and the neighbors in the west are the Nyore. The Luos are on the southern side. Tiriki on the east side and the Idakho on the north side. Ours is Kilingili. Bakisami, Nyore and Idakho are joining together with the Maragoli. Long roads are passing through Maragoli, one is coming from Kisumu to Kakamega. One road is coming from Kapsabet to Chavakali. Another one is coming from Majengo, Keveye to Lwanda. Two roads are from Chavakali, one is heading to Kilingili and the other one to Eregi. Another one is from Majengo to Munzatsi and Hamisi. The one for Hamisi is breaking at Gisambai to Kivagala. Kisangula, Kigama to Mudete. Another road is from Mago, through Ivusweta to Busali Union Secondary School, to Mululu. Another one from Mudete through Wangulu, Bugina to Mululu. Two rads are from Mbale, one is going to Imbihi to Imagada Bunyore and another one goes to Kegoye to Matsigulu to Gisambai, another one from Vuguga to Imagada to Bunyore, another one from Vihiga, it goes to Gavalaji, to Lusiola. Another road is from Mahanga to Ichavavo and Kerongo. The land of Maragoli has many hills and rocks on the southern side. These hills are in the southern part of maragoli.</p>
<p>It has moved to Lusiola and Ikumba.it started from Changuzi to Ichandolo. It moved from Liamagale and Vinditsi. Wangumbi of the northern side. There are hills at Kisangula towards Tiriki Igavilembo. The rivers in maragoli are not big. The biggest river that goes through maragoli is Itsava. The other rivers in maragoli were flowing to other parts of maragoli and they were changing their names according to where they were flowing to. Some of the smallest rivers in maragoli are Wagikuyu, Lusala, Luveyi, Ehedwe, Walunyu, Wamondo. There are others that the land of maragoli has. It also has forests and swamps and the rain that is raining in maragoli is from Nandi hills in east. Sometimes it can come from southern part from Lake Victoria in Kisumu. The year of planting in maragoli has two seasons. One season is for digging in preparation for the rain. It is called the digging of Gudu. The second digging begins in November or December. It extends to February of the other year. The rain that makes crops to grow begins in February to march then it moves to June or July. They take a short while then they are ready like beans and millet. The harvest of Gudu is more than that of Chuvwe. In planting at maragoli millet and wheat does well since long time ago. The maize came in when the white men stopped here other crops like beans, cassava, potatoes groundnuts, flour and others. Some if these are from the season of Chuvwe. At the home of Mulogoli there were bananas. The vegetables of Mulogoli are likuvi, livogoi, tsisaga, mutere, mito, magalaba and tsimboga. New crops in maragoli are coffee and tea. The white men started them between 1950 and 1980. They were missionaries who brought them to Africa and asked them to start planting.</p>
<p>Since long time ago the cattle of Mulogoli were cows, a goat together with sheep. The dressing of Mulogoli; he began putting on the cow skin. They were from his cattle or wild animals that he was hunting. From his cattle is where he was getting meat to eat and milk too drink. A maragoli of the past was a good farmer and he was using other food that he was getting by other means that were different. Some of it was mushroom of all types. The mushroom that the mulogoli was eating was "Vunamatsi, vunasina, vunamori, vugusuma, vugutswe and chamegere." Other food was ants, he was scooping them to use as food. The maragolis love hunting and keeping quails. A quail is a good meal to a mulogoli. The maragoli of the past liked hunting other birds that they were eaten. Different sorts of fish are a diet of Mulogoli. Maragoli of the past used pots to keep in their cereals. Gourds were used to carry in vegetables. </p>
<p>Baskets were used for winnowing the cereals to remove chaff. An open basket was also used for winnowing the seeds. The food of the past was kederu, ikituva, ikinu, ikiivu nu lubagu. Ihati was used for milking and drinking milk. Horn was used for drinking milk. Old men had their rituals. Gourds were used for drinking water or porridge. Kinu was used for grinding cassava. Grinding flour was done on a mill that was made of stone. There were pots for cooking and one of them was used for cooking baked maize flour. There was another pot for cooking in vegetables. There was a pot for cooking hen. There was a pot for cooking in fish or sweet food. The big pot was used for cooking in beans or for pouring in more water. The pot was also used for fetching water. Isika was a big pot for storing in cereals. Gourds were used for fermenting milk for drinking. The porridge that the maragoli loved taking was the fermented porridge. Sharp objetcs for maragoli were used in war to fight enemies. They were hunting animals in the forest using the arrows, spears and they had shield for protecting themselves. For many years the land of maragoli had been divided into two. The southern maragoli with the 12 locations and the northern maragoli with 16 locations, behind the northern maragoli it was divided into two the western with it's seven locations and the eastern that had nine locations.</p>
<p>Maragoli are among the Kenyans with high population rate than other tribes in Kenya. In this state they are adding and their land is less to them. Some went to buy land from other areas and they left Maragoli and went to stay there in those places. Some went to Tiriki, Nyang'ori and Naandi. And some went to Isukha, Kabras and some to Kisii, South Nyanza, Bware, Migori and Tanzania and some have gone to Kigumba in Uganda. Others were found land in schemes and they started work that they do in the villages in Kenya. Doing this reduced problems in the land of Maragoli.</p>
