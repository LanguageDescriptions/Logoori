<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">A widow who wants to get married</p>
<p>That girl or widow in that home, if there were some boys there who were brothers to the husband of the widow who died. They used to agree one of the brothers to remarry the widow again. If she had given birth to kids, they used to say this brother wants again to marry the brother's wife so that she can dig for the kids for them to grow up. She slash the ground and dig for the for the children to grow up. They used to do that.</p>
<p>What caused a man to marry many wives was as a result of giving birth to girls only. Then he says, "no I have married this girl and she has given birth to girls alone" those girls were called frogs. People of the past used to call girls frogs. Then he marries another woman and says "I want to give birth to a boy who can take care of the mother even if I am not there" this boy will be there and he will take care of the mother, or the other wife. If the husband died they didn't allow the second wife to leave, they allowed her to stay with the boy child. Even if she left, when the boy grew up, he used to bring her back home.</p>
<p>We had some women who could reach at a certain point in life and they started to go out (being adulterous) then she gives birth to a child while she is still in another marriage.</p>
<p>What did they do to that woman?</p>
<p>If that woman left her house to go and sleep with another man, she was called an adulterous woman (muheyi means adulterous person) now this adulterous woman if she got problems where she went, maybe the man has not treated her well. When she returned back to her home where she was born, her people used to go back where she had been married and they humble themselves "we know our girl has not done you well, we want you to forgive her and let her return back to her house and take care of her children" they then agree with the husband and they love the parents. The girl's parents used to take a cow and give the girl to take it to her husband because she left and became a prostitute and now she is begging to come back and take care of the children.</p>
<p>We had some clans that used to keep cheetahs or snakes as pets.</p>
<p>Have you heard about those clans? </p>
<p>Like me the way I am I have never kept such a thing at all. I have never kept a cheetah, snake or tortoise. If a girl was getting married to the house where these things were kept, this girl used to go back to their home, then they take a snake and keep it inside a pot and give her to go with it, wherever she was getting married. For me in my home I do not have such a thing. I refused that thing and I do not want it.</p>
<p>Even if a girl is light skin, fat or tall, I do not want her in my home if she has a snake or a cheetah, because I have never kept such things. I didn't know how they were keeping cheetah or snake. That girl wont be allowed in my home. And if my son will feel that she is his wife and he wants to allow her to come in with such pets then they will have to leave my homestead, go and look for another place where they will keep such pets. </p>
<p>Long time ago when someone died there were no coffins. They used to dig down, we have some grass called "ivembe" after bringing that grass then they spread it down, and then they dig at the corner of the wall. They cut some short sticks they come and place them inside, then they come and cut that "ivembe" and place it on the sticks. They take the dead and burry him on the ground so that the soil cannot get in contact with the body and they take the sticks and spread on top of him. Then they start to balance the soil and that is what they used to call a coffin that they used to keep in a dead person. After burying the relatives used to stay there for two day they say that they want to remove a razor. Then they take the first-born child and they take razor blades they ask him to sit down after washing his head. Now a man wants to work on this child, by shaving him. They removed a razor blade then they shave this child. After shaving the first-born they then shave others. Now people who wanted to leave, they were released and the ones that were remaining they were free to embark on their daily routine, go to work. That one has gone like that.</p>
