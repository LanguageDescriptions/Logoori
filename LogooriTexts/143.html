Matemwa yaga genganga nukatsie kugulitsa hayi we kehera tsana navula; mengu mumanya mulie. Na vandu vamenya. Ma vava vakomela, vanwa ovosera vwe kirungu. Kalunu ichai iyi nuha mwana hadi mwana agenda genda vutsa anina ku kasala yenya kapera, yiva wa kakonye kaveye; kijira vindu viene vila viageha mu avana. Ku liali likutsila ma nguyu kuduchi mu kivala cha valogoli. Valogoli vali vatia likuva lia nyasaye. Kandi mu kivala yimu vandu ni watsitsa vavola tsa valogoli yivo vandu vatanga kolola mang'ana ga nyasaye. Kalunu valogoli vaveye kusula; wa mavugano gaveye ni mu vavugusu ni vivala vinde. Na kunyi valogoli kwa yilani inyma kumanyi ling'ana lia nyasaye dave, avolanga inze ndi kali nimba nimbugana, kali nengola yaga ndatsia na ndio unyala da kijira malago gaveyemu gahandikwa gatihitsanga vindu ngani galange gatihitsange yava ni vamenya mu inzila indahi. Ku gnotwa vakkunula kitabu ki kivavola oheye, wive, utsie ku mukali wu mundu ma lelo kandi utsie kandi usingila imbili ovola, oh, nyasaye yitsominywe. ma ohenza ku okola ma ku icho keheri cha tsana cha vakovolanga kilava kiduka.

Ni ligenda lilie lilamuha madiku gege alamenya mu kivala alalia ku miandu jia nyasaye. Nu wikutsiyi, ni wa va mubarabari, onyola ku da. Ulanyangana tsa vandi valia na yive nukuba kivi, na makono gogo gaveye ni tsinguru, kalunu mulanyola lilia na kale vwali vuritu. Vasungu yava vatsa ku vamwamu vahombelitsa vudinyu vwene kabisa paga kuduka vavugila ling'ana lia nyasaye na valigenditsa mu inzila indahi. Si valigenditsanga kuli kalunu da.

Ku vasungu kweli vakoletela vindu vilahi vigasu navutswa vandu lwa vanwetsa vosera vandu vakirigita tsa yimu. Ku lwa vandu valeta kali livuyu lia olola yili mundu mukali vwali vudinyu kulia ku livuyu yili. Mundu musakulu yasinza vutsa engoko yeye ma yerenya ku ma avola mundu mukali alia ku  engoko iyi dave.

Ku vandu vamanya mang'ana ga nyasaye, vamanya vutswa nimba nimenya mu nyasaye na nengola mang'ana ga nyasaye, nyasaye alamba vindu vilahi na ndamenya nimbeye mu vindu viveye vilahi kuvita kuvugula mang'ana ga nyasaye nu kwonogonyia no kogenda, nu kuvula kumanya lilago liveho dave. Kutumikila lilago ni kindu kilahi, kutumikila mu ligenda lilahi na ulamenya mu inzila iveye indahi kandi ulahula noveye mundu mulahi mu ligenda lilio ni mu liviluka lilio ni mu liyinzila lilio nuhanda ku nyasaye. Kijira vaketa ivangeli vaveye ni vugasu vandu vamenya mu nyasaye kandi vaveye ni vugasu vandu vikutsilanga mu likuva lia yahova nyasaye kijira vilwatsa ivangeli kandi vimba ku tsinyimbu tsidinyilitsanga vakristayo.

Kandi kuvalekelanga vang'ele yava malago uligimila malago kandi na yilwatsili ku vandi na avana veve na utagmila malago nahenzahenza yiku asingili inyumba yeye mu inzila indahi dave; yicho chajira valeta ling'ana llia nyasaye; likuvika tsinguvu, virato.

<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Our people</p>
<p>I have happiness in this house and the date is 6/5/2014 and I am Jeddah Mmbone and I am speaking about the things that our people used to do because the maragoli had problems in their walking and lives. Because the maragoli people were haredwordking but they were not earning much money. These people their money was food and to get food was very difficult. They were living in perservirence to get money. Thy got to a point and they wondered what they could do in their perservirence the white men came to this land and began to convince them. It was difficult when the white man came people used to run away when they see them. They didn't want to see the Whiteman moving near where they were. The white men wonderd what they could do to those people because when they see them they run away. They thought of how they will get elder people to speak to the maragoli inorder for them to talk with the white men. They used to appoint someone who was staying in the urban area to speak with the white men on behalf of them. They used to see the white men they run away and some sy that when you hide in the bush the white man won't follow you. They used to run away and hide in the buch and then the white man stands on the side. They convinced the people until they knew that the whte man is like another human being like them. They talked to the white men to help their people to stay in peace because they were suffering in their lives. They convinced them to come and sit in a one place, then the white men came and found the maragoli sitting in one place, then they told the maragoli that they were white men who came there and they had words that they wanted to tell them. And the words were of help to them. The white men wondered what they could do to those people. They started convincing people and bringing them to the markets, they organized and came with their vehicle, they prepared tea in big containers, they begged people to come and drink that tea. They used to drink and say yes we have drunk and it is good while others refuse and say, a white man has a brain that he is grinding and giving you as sugar to take and others say that it was not brain it was sugar. They did that in the year 1909. They convinced our people to come near, the people who were staying with the white people and cooking for them they used to come and tell others that they are good people. They used to give us things and then they say that we are good and we should start planting our things, they start keeping cows and milking cows because they didn't see anywhere where milk was sold. When days came they found a place where they were going to sell the milk and they were selling one cup at 1 cent and others were cooking this tea, getting tea leaves was difficult people used to take the covers of the leamn and use them to cook tea. People wre learning like that and that is when they got to a point of staying with the white men while they were still familiarizing with them. The black people discovered that they wre running away from good people. In our live with the white men they came and asked people to gather in one place, they came and started reading the bible and asked people to gather themselves and accept the word of God. Many people were drinking alcohol in the past even the women. They told them the issue of taking alcohol was not good, they wre to stop taking alcohol, they be good people, God's Christians. He contined convincing them and the people started coming slowly until he taught them the word of God. When they saw that they had known the word of God, they wree very happy and they made some people preachers, when the white man was speaking in English and his interpretor interprets that the white man is aking them to stop alcohol, they were to stop bad things and turn to God. People were happy and they began their religion. When they made their religions people started knowing God and the whte men asked them to live in peace, people were reading and writing their books and then they give others who read for others. That made Christianity to spread in the right way. They kept the laws on people and they told them that if they walk with God they will be good people and God will give them good things. The maragoli people had problems, they didn't have something that they were using in the right way, they had problems, and they were walking naked. That moment was difficult when the white men came in that is when they got relieved. People began buying clothes; they started telling them how the clothes that they were wearing should be. They knit for people sisal clothes. When someone kept it on he/she felt that she was okay; again when she was walking she felt that she was fine, with the cloth on she was okay. Sleeping was a problem, people finding a blanket was difficult and they were sleeping as animals. They were lighting fire in that house, while it was burning someone was sleeping like that; she didn't have a cloth that she was covering herself with. That is when the white men came in and showed us how to use the cloth, you put it on during the day time and you use it to cover your body at night as a blanket. Again for the children you use to take a cloth that is torn and then you give them to cover themselves at night. It was very difficult for the life of Mulogoli; his life was difficult; that is when the whitre men brought light to the world. They told them that today they will know how to eat things. This bread was difficult to eat, when they give you some used to sya that you will die if you eat things that the white man is giving you and the courageous ones used to tell them that these things were good. People came from far since that time. Maragoli people didn't have an easy life, they had their problems and that is when they brought in cloths and people started putting them on. That is when the white men walked around and spread the word of God, they read the word to people and they understood it and stayed with the white men. They told them that church is a good thing and they brought it to the maragoli and they became the people of church. They were staying well in Christianity, they were walking in the right way, they were not Christians who were saying that they do this against what they were told like they were not to steal, commit adultery, do not killing, if you wanted to become a Christian you were to stop these things and God will help you. We were like that and it when when the word of God was spread to the people people used to gather them together, among three or five people they were gathering themselves together, they read the word of God and they begin to sing. The white man was singing in English and the mulogoli was singing like this:</p>
<p>Happiness*3</p>
<p>We are rejoicing today</p>
<p>Happiness*3</p>
<p>We are praising God</p>
<p>When our friends have arrived here</p>
<p>We have joy in our hearts</p>
<p></p>
<p>Peace*3</p>
<p>We are rejoicing today</p>
<p>Peace*3</p>
<p>We are praising the lord</p>
<p>When our friends have arrived here</p>
<p>We have joy in our hearts</p>
<p>And people move on like that as they aquaint slowly, they continued like that and they learned slowly that is when the church grew, the Christians were now there, they made for them a theology school, the maragoli people were to go and learn the bible. People went to learn the bible and they brought a good thing that is when people knew what they should eat. That is when people knew that there were good things, this oil was difficult for someone to use to cook when she was given she used to drop a little and then she says that if you put in all it will make one to have huge feet and hands, someone used to take little oil and soda ash and then she adds in the vegetables and sya that the white men things will kill them. Then they walked to where trhey were walking and they educated their children. And their children were reading and going infront where the white men were, you take and eat these things our people you will be good, when you take milk tea you will be good, as you eat meat; they used to slaughter meat and they were not taking it to the market, someone was slaughtering the cow from his home. Someone was bringing the millet, they cut the meat, and someone brings the maize as they cut the meat. People were like that it is today when the world became good and as it thinks that it is good that is when it is getting spoiled. Today people are not considering the laws that they had, it went with the people of the past, old men of the past, who were Isaiah Kayeli, Jacob, Ichandaye; those were the people who went with their laws the children have taken over and when things become tough they escape. Evn when someone has a wife, she asks him to buy for her a tgype of cloth and if he doesn't he won't manage, he should give her the way he gives others. Another one says that one is frying meat while she is eating vegetables, she tells the husband that she doesn't want him in that house, he should go out and look for work, long time ago someone was not sending a man to work, they used to say that if you tell a man to go he won't stay long he will die and be brought back when he is dead. Those things today people have focused on other things and left those laws. The laws of saying you walk in the right way, our children have left them, they have left them and said that other things have come in. it is true the white man used to say that even if they refuse the word of God, there will come a time. There was no money and people were naked. A naked white man will come to this world and the ones who will be taking her will have problems, they were to be patient and follow Christianity, God will provide what to use and add him his many days. The things of this world are difficult; it is full of sin, it is full of killings the way the white men were telling us that when the world will be okay we will have problems. In the world our children have worked and received education, they traveling by aeroplane, they are given a lot of money and they come and do their own things and you remain like that and when you try to follow you get lost. You won't find anything. For the things of this world, this world is difficult; it is full of sin, a lot of killings; among the things that the white men told us. The white men told us that we will have problems when our world will be good we won't have the truth. You eat your green vegetables as you pray, as you eat your green vegetable you pray to God. Because for him the meat will come to the end of its season but for you cannot admire another one's moment. These days if you admire another ones moment you will leave your children in problems. Your homestead will not be good because you admire good things; meat, money. And money will put you in problems. And that is the reason to why people in the past used to say that you should perservire. When you get married to someone who is poor and you have a small land, just stick to him. We used to stick and they tell us that if land is there one should not move away. And you work and get food. Getting food in our days was a problem. When you had banana you leave it to ripe together with the stuck; today it is not there it has lost. Today it is money that is there. The bananas were five but today you are given only one; and long time ago that is when they were keeping bananas, they used to get a big stuck and they put it in a basket. These bananas used to get ripe and where could you sell other then eating the bananas. And people were surviving and they become health, they were drinking fermented porridge. Today when you give a child tea the child begins to walk and he climbs on a tree to pluck a guava, youi have assisted him to grow; because those things have reduced in children. It was perservirence in the land of maragoli. The maragolis feared the word of the lord. In this land wherever you were going people used to say that the maragoli are the ones who knew the word of God. Today the maragoli have spread; where the churches and blessings are and other parts of the world. We the maragoli have moved behind we do not know the word of God, he says that even if he fellowship he will still die and that way you cannot manage because there are laws that are written they guiding those that are living in the right way. I do not know which book they are opening that says one should be adulterous, steal, you spend with another man's wife and you come and stand before people and say; praise God. And then you see what you are doing and that is the disaster that they were telling us that it will come. We thought we will never reach there. We used to hear the year 1990 and then we wonder if we will get there. God has made everyone with his death. His wlak will add him hios days he will eat the things of the world. If you are patient, if you are impatient you won't get anything. You will have problems while others eat you suffer, and your hands have energy, today you get food but long time it was a problem. These white men came to the blacks and they begged them until they knew the word of God and they moved it in the right way. They were not moving it like these days. Today they tell you that they have found a new world given a new name. That name is the one that people loved and ran to; they do not bother that we are children of God. Today it is very difficult; it is not good. Our life was good with our people of the past they were not having issues the way we have. Whte men have brought us good things of blessings but when people take porridge they just move within. When people brought the egg that you are seeing, it was difficult for a woman to eat an egg. A man used to slaughter his hen and then he refuse that the woman should not eat it. That was selfishness that if women eat good things they will be spoiled. They had thoughts that we used to capture wordsfor seeing that if they told people that those people will get spoiled. People used to walk and say that they were good people, they wre not to do things, happiness has come and has made many people to get lost, in the church of God people cannot pray, they cannot do the work of God. People have taken the word of God lightly and the word of God was good, people were living even those who were poor when the white men came and said that they were to take the word of God, when you read in the bible you will find happiness and many things. And for sure the one who educated children that time he sees vehicle at his home moving around; the home looks like that of a white man. And people who do not know that are just there, they do not know what they are doing. They are just there. People who knew the word of God, they know that if they stay in God and do the things of God, God will give them good things and they will live in those good things without taking the word of God is destroying the journey, and without knowing that there is law. Using the law is a good thing, walking in the right way you will live in a way that is right. And you will feel good in your walk and when you wake up and also in your work when you stick to God. They brought the bile and they have blessings that tha live in God again they have blessings those that perservire in the word of God because they preach from the bible and they sing songs that strengthen Christianity. They sing spiritual songs because for the spirit to enter someone heart was dificult. That person must have humbled himself in his life and walk; spend time in prayers, and crying. And in your heart you cannot admire these things; you take it as a joke. And when you find where you are living you are admiring something that another person has and you are wishing to have it then God will never help you. Let him eat during his time and when your time comes you will also eat. We should mperservire in the right way of life, people in the past used to perservire in their walk. Today the children are saying that was ours and it has no help to them; today we've been brought up while we are seeing things and we do not have poverty. And when you visit the rich, the rich won't welcome you. The children of today will ask how the woman is looking like, tell her to sit outside. And Christians encourage people to welcome the aged woman, you share what you have eaten and she say thank you. Today they do not want women and the women are not there; they are finished and today we are teaching the young people the laws the one who will hold the laws will teach others and the children that are not holding the laws and moving here and there without holding their families strongly; that is the reason to why they brought the word of God; putting on cloths, shoes. The feet of people were dry and could not fit in a shoe, when given a shoe you put in one foot and you add in another foot. You used to walk on it and you wonder how you have kept it on. They used to take that shoe you put it on and also put on another shoe and you walk for a long distance you used to walk because you have the shoes on, you used to walk far. The white men brought blessings here; they brought us from far because our people in the past were determined. People were sleeping without covering themselves with anything; you know it was an issue. They were sleeping while they bask on fire; a woman used to sleep there while a man sleeps there. And the ash goes on them and when they wake up they have nothing. That is when they brought the blanket; you find you have the blanket on. Another one will ask you to buy a cloth. And there was no much money, it was only one shilling; a blanket was being sold at three shillings. Then it moved on to five shillings, people spread all over and they made a place where they could rest in a right way. We have stayed like that up to today. The word of God has made people to be good but but they have brought in the issues of sickness when they read in the bible they say that a certain type of sickness is coming and it will be brought by scorpion. It will be cutting someone and these words have spread all over the world. That is when death will come in, people will perish and the world will remaine empty and yet we do not know, if God will say that they get out and another generation to come in; we do not know. We are on the walk, patience and prayer; we pray for got to find those that will be conquer and others will be crawling if they do not follow. The world has come with its issues and sayings, and we are there walking in it. And we are concerned about the children today if you do not have money you won't survive on earth because the things that the white men brought us they have escaped what will you do? They did well because we had a lot of problems the happiness that they brought and all those things they have made people to wonder what will happen when the white men goes back home, they used to call money prostitute. Money has come in and you see the prostitutes are in trhe world they are thinking that people should come and eat good things. The tgood things have brought confusion and a child who is patient and learning something that she can teach her child and when the child hears he will live, he will live and his days will be more on the world. That is the reason to why we are telling our children to unite and God will give them wisdom because if youi want the past things you won't get them. It has passed with those people, and those years, today children do not care who someone is. When he wants to marry he doesn't ask the girl belongs to which tribe. Because long time ago they used to tell us that if you want to chase after a gilr you belong to which tribe, she tells you that she is a "mmasingila, mwifa" in Ivusaina. And the boy tells you that he is msaniaga, mwifwa from mukisa. Today no one bothers to ask. Someone does nto ask whom she is; when he see the girl and the girl has seen him they come together happily and the following day the girl is pregnant. You wonder where you will take the child since he has given birth with a relative. Then you move on with that issue, lelo wuma vutsa naye mwoyo gogotwa a nambile wavu mwana uyu ma gava vutsa kogenyi. When relativeness comes in it will finish your house because you have brought a relative to your house, all the people will perish. They will have huge legs and the body will have sores. Today we do not have a place where we are heading. That is the reason to why we tell the children to be patient and also listen. When you stay with the child and yell at her, she won't want to move near you. And the child begins to walk far away from you and you wonder that you thought you were teaching her instead she felt that you were disturbing her. The following day that child gets spoiled. We are in this world full of problems, a lot of different things. We should ask God to help us because long time ago people didn't have a lot of issues. No one had the intension of complaining. Today the population is high and it has brought us problems. Where we are our children should move close to God, maybe God will move close to us so that we get a new laws that we can hold you should hold the word of God and read the bible, and one will live on this world. All the children will not be like that there will be two or three who will listen to his word. And we should perservire in this life; it is hot because of money. Money is a problem and it has brought destruction, there is no peace. Those are the issues of perserviring in this world.</p>
<p>There are no laws that a person can teach and everyone complys with it. There are no people who can teach the law and hold them because at that time when they were teaching the bible; when the white men brought the bible and people moved close to it, they moved closed to the white men and the people who were working for the white men used to come and tell them that the things that they were running away from were good. Long time they used to bring a type of meat that was canned; they were cooked from the containers. Those people used to bring it to them and they eat and say that the white people's things were good, if they eat they can assist them. Then they tell them that when they are taking those things they should take with Christianity. Those days that were past you saw the way I said they were sharing, Chandaye and others made their laws. Those people were saying that people should not be used to money if they get used to money they will be spoiled. If you get you use on food and also use the money to buy something reasonable in the house. Long time ago someone was not sending one a lot of cash with the reason that if he does the money will spoil that person. It is true a woman can be sent 7000 shillings and tomorrow you won't get, has she followed the laws? Is she keeping the laws? She is not keeping the laws they used to emphasize. When these children took over the laws; Daudi Kadenge, Charles Lulu these people walked in the right Christianity. They said you shildren the bible is saying you should not do bad things. You keep the laws. They continued preaching until they got hold of it. Even when they preach you hear them saying that the Friends are singing slowly; they sing slowly. Even we the Pentecostals when you hear them jumping they preach to the people and they get holyu spirit. And they tell them that if they receive holy spirit he will show you things. And when you want to do things the heart says you should not, you stop. People were like that and that generation grew and knew the laws. Today this money that you see they say that if you give a woman and gets used to them she doesn't stay in the house. Those in the past were not giving anyone money, a man was keeping his money and he knows that if she sents it to a woman she will use it. He used to send and when he finds that the woman has spend all it was difficult for him to send her more money. And when he finds that she has bought a hen and kept it there, she has kept a sheep there; she has kept someone on the farm to dig. He used to see that the wife is wise and she is good. That is what made the word of God to spread. And then they said that when you go to the church, you should not do bad things because if you do bad things another person will do bad things, again the other one will do the same. When a person did bad things he was on probation from church for 12 months; he was not allowed to work there. Someone was afraid that if he does a mistake he will be on probation. Today is that probation still on? The laws have gone. Even these years that we are in you people have tried those that are ahead will not mention that; when the world is spoiled. We had Sunday school teachers and the children were keeping the laws that they were taught. Today they sing songs but they do not hold the laws. The things that you see today the people are used to the church; they go there for minutes, one hour; the eyes are looking somewhere else, what is he telling us; long time we used to perservire for even two hours. Today when you preach you arte just in the church, you preach for one hour and they complain. You hear digital and you wonder it is what; they are heading nowhere. Thank you.</p>
