<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Girls who went to gather firewood</p>
<p>They call me Jedda Mmbone. We are sitting here on the date of 19/3/2014 and I have things that I want to talk about. I will start with a story.</p>
<p>We had three girls who went to look for firewood. They some said they go to look for firewood while others said no. There was a woman there who suggested that the three should go and look for firewood, while the other three should follow her, she has someone who wants to pick on the girls. When the three girls came they said that they had met someone who wanted to marry them. One of the girls said "I do not want a man" the woman pleaded other girls to talk to her, that she accept to get married and bring her cows. When that girl heard that she ran away. When she ran away she went to climb on a tree that was cool near the river. She used to see someone coming then she plucks a leaf and throws it there. People were wondering what it was. The mother said that her girl ran away when she asked her to get married and she is lost. They didn't know where she had gone. When the first girl went the second one came to the river, and when she looked up, the girl on the tree dropped a leaf. And the girl who was down said that she had found their girl, she ran away and she is on the tree and she wondered what they could do. The woman came and said:</p>
<p>My girl come down*2</p>
<p>We go and cut uba</p>
<p>We cut uba</p>
<p>We go and cut idarinda</p>
<p></p>
<p>The girl refused to come down. She began to sing again</p>
<p></p>
<p>My girl come down*2</p>
<p>We go and cut uba</p>
<p>We cut uba</p>
<p>We go and cut idarinda</p>
<p>They went and called the aunt who came and said:</p>
<p>My niece come down*2</p>
<p>We go and cut uba</p>
<p>We cut uba</p>
<p>We go and cut idarinda</p>
<p>The girl refused then they went and called the friends who came and said:</p>
<p>My friend come down*2</p>
<p>We go and cut uba</p>
<p>We cut uba</p>
<p>We go and cut idarinda</p>
<p>They tired but it was all in vain. Then they called the man who wanted to marry her, and he came and started singing:</p>
<p>My friend come down*2</p>
<p>We go and cut uba</p>
<p>We cut uba</p>
<p>We go and cut idarinda</p>
<p>That girl said</p>
<p>My friend I will come down*2</p>
<p>We go and cut uba</p>
<p>We cut uba</p>
<p>We go and cut idarinda</p>
<p>That girl came down then she went with that man, when they went she arrived at the gate and she said that she doesn't want to enter.</p>
<p>What will I enter with in through your gate?</p>
<p>I want a gazelle and a goat I enter with it</p>
<p>I have found who will enter*2</p>
<p>My friend</p>
<p></p>
<p>They brought a cow and a goat; she moved to the door and began to sing:</p>
<p>What will I enter with in through your gate?</p>
<p>I want a gazelle and a goat I enter with it</p>
<p>I have found who will enter*2</p>
<p>My friend</p>
<p>They brought a cow and a goat. When she came in she refused to sit down. And she began to sing:</p>
<p>On this seat of yours what will I sit with?</p>
<p>I want a gazelle and a goat I enter with it</p>
<p>I have found who will enter*2</p>
<p>My friend</p>
<p>They brought the goat and the cow, then they brought meals that they had prepared for the bride and she refused "I am not eating" she then began:</p>
<p>These meals of yours I will eat with what?</p>
<p>I want a gazelle and a goat I enter with it</p>
<p>I have found who will enter*2</p>
<p>My friend</p>
<p>And the cows were out, they called her people who came and found the cows then they took them. </p>
<p>It has ended there.</p>
<p>Nakamuna and Nakanani were both children. They used to share their ideas wherever they were seated. It reached a point and Kanani suggested that they go and eat their mother. You go and eat your mother while I eat mine. Nakamuna while he was on the road, he thought and said "what, I go and eat my mother really?" Nakanani ran very fast and ate his mother. When he ate the mother Nakamuna kept quiet and didn't eat his mother. When they met Nakanani came and asked Nakamuna if he ate his mother. Nakamuna had killed lizards and smeared the blood on his hands and he said, "I have killed mum and ate her" while they were walking together Nakanani came and said "Nakamuna, I am sitting with you but I am seeing that you are very healthy, what are you eating? Since I ate my mother I am not healthy, hunger is killing me." He spied and discovered that it seems like Nakamuna didn't eat his mother. When Nakamuna went home, Nakanani followed him secretly. Nakamuna used to say:</p>
<p>Mother drop the rope I climb, wee I climb*2</p>
<p>I climb wee I climb*2</p>
<p>Then she opens the door Nakamuna gets in and eats, and then he goes to meet Nakanani very far from the home. Whenever Nakamuna wanted to get in he used to do that. The following day Nakanani said that he wants to watch over Nakamuna, it seems like he didn't eat his mother. When Nakamuna went home and he wanted to get inside, he sang: </p>
<p>Mother drop the rope I climb, wee I climb*2</p>
<p>I climb wee I climb*2</p>
<p>When she dropped the rope, Nakanani saw Nakamuna entering inside and going to eat baked maize flour, and then he came back. In the evening Nakanani decided not to walk with Nakamuna. He said that he wanted to walk alone and then he go and see the way Nakamuna's mother prepares meals for her. When reached there he said:</p>
<p>Mother drop the rope I climb, wee I climb*2</p>
<p>I climb wee I climb*2</p>
<p>When he did that the mother said that it was not his son's voice. The voice of his son does not sound like that. The mother was patient. Nakamuna was walking outside and he came while Nakanani was hiding himself ready to listen to the voice of Nakamuna. When Nakamuna came and sang:</p>
<p>Mother drop the rope I climb, wee I climb*2</p>
<p>I climb wee I climb*2</p>
<p>When she dropped the rope, Nakanani saw Nakamuna getting and going to eat. And he said, "ooh! That is how Nakamuna normally sings?" the following day he came and began singing like Nakamuna:</p>
<p>Mother drop the rope I climb, wee I climb*2</p>
<p>I climb wee I climb*2</p>
<p>When the woman pulled the rope, Nakanani bumped inside and he went, took the mother and ate her. Nakamuna came and sang, but he found that things had changed. It has ended there. That is the life of today.</p>
<p>We are living in the world we people of the previous years who were waling naked. People didn't have clothes. People were walking naked. Men had made a small cover from a cow skin. They used to cover the back part, then the front. And women were using one that they tied on the waist. When you are walking when you meet a boy, you take that cover and you cover your front part. When you walk and meet another one who is coming from the back, you then use it to cover the back part. People in the past were very creative and people came from far and began telling people to start using clothes. People in the past had this creative ways. We used to walk naked like that, and then it reached a point they said that we should start putting on cow skins. Someone takes a rope then he/she puts it on the cow skin, it runs from one point to the other, that skin covers the two parts and leaves the rest. People were waling and when a boy met a woman, he used to adjust the cover, then after passing, he returns it back. We grew up in tough life until when we got to the stage of getting married.</p>
<p>Women used to sleep with girls in one house. They then asked the boys to sleep in the seating room if it is a big house. And the girls sleep where the woman is. Those people didn't care, or boys never bothered about chasing after their girls. When they have said that they are sisters, people sleep like that. The following morning people leave. The girls where they went they used to cut banana leaves, or you steal your mothers dress you and use it to cover yourself over the night. There was no cloth by that time, people used to take sacks as cloths, and they put in their legs. People used to walk, we used to apply cow oil on our skin. We used to ferment milk in a gourd; after it has become thick that is what people will use as jelly oil. And if you slept with an old woman she used to teach you. People were not getting married at the age of 14 or 15. A girl used to mature and when she walks people knows that someone's daughter is ready. They used to teach her work so that she can never lack the knowledge when she gets married to a certain homestead. We used to go to the river with a huge pot. When you go to the river as a young girl you learn how they put a pot on the head. When you reach at the river you look for a slightly steep place, you put your foot there and then you take the pot and place it on your knee, then you struggle and put the pot on your head. Now when you do it several times, you now know that you are a mature lady who can get married. We grew up like that it is until recently when they brought cloths. When they brought cloths, they first began knitting "kiburu" when people brought it some used to hang themselves because of it. My husband had to buy for me this "kiburu" if he doesn't the wife takes a rope and hangs her life. That is when we began knitting cloths and we were making them from flowers. They used to mix colours of the cloths. When you put on the cloths you feel like you are a young girl. We went through life, it is until recent when they brought cloths, shoes, and people are eating and drinking. Long time ago people used to drink porridge they were not taking tea that porridge used to stay in the pot and they used to call it "ikilungu" you come and pour it on a gourd that has been cut half. We didn't have plates. We used to take the half cut gourd and they serve us the porridge on it. Then you drink it. They were molding pots and plates that they kept on baked maize flour and you eat from there. These days they have brought sunshine things are there. We didn't have hospitals by that time. When a woman was about to give birth, there were women who took care of it. When you are seven month pregnant you wake up and go to the old woman's house, you find the woman has prepared cold water and you sleep in the seating room. And you are very keen with your belly, she then takes that water and soap then she test and see if the baby is okay. If the baby, has turned you just know that he/she wont walk well, she will massage you slowly, at the eighth month you just know that the child is almost ready and you tell her. Not like today the child is okay and plays in the stomach. We used to encourage one another like that until the time when the child is ready. When she is in labor pain she will ask you to go and call for her the mother in law, we women we were in trouble since the hospitals were not there. Until you take a woman, and she kneels on one side and the other one on the other side, then you ask her to move her legs apart, after that you help her to push the baby until she gives birth to that baby. The baby used to fall down, these days they put something down where the baby falls on. You used to push a baby and she falls on the soil, then you take her and cut the umbilical cord. Those are the things that we faced as we were growing up. When they brought hospitals that is when they chose women to go and take care of the pregnant women. There was no syringe that they were given. If you had a small vagina, a woman had to take a nail and cut you so that the baby comes out these days you see they are operating with scissors. Sometimes the baby used to come out when she/he is dead. Those are the things we faced as we struggle through the days that God has taken care of us. We have good years that we are walking in as we try and we know that we have come from far, we have gone far. We have seen things that we had never seen. That is why we are living in this world. The young people these days they are being given medicine when they go to the medical health centers. For our case we were not given medicine, we used to give birth like that. I believe my words have reached there like that.</p>
