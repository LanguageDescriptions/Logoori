<p>Population of maragoli</p>
<p>It is not easy to know the population of maragoli wherever they are in Kenya and other places because they have ran away from Maragoli to other places. They are counted from where they ran. Again when people were counted in Kenya in the year 1969 up to 1979 many people in the homesteads and everywhere else were counted where they were. The whole population of maragoli in Kenya was 120,000. The maragoli are among the people with high population in Kenya. It is like 4% in a year. Early ten years before the counting in 1969 to 1979 the maragoli in maragoli that were counted were 170,000 and after ten years in 1989 they were 250,000. Now they may be 300,00 according to the rate of birth in the year 2000 we like the maragoli to take care in the tribe of maragoli and have blessings and moving the land of maragoli forward. I believe that is what I liked to tell you up to today on the history of Maragoli. </p>
