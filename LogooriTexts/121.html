<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Giving birth to a baby boy</p>
<p>Long time ago we had a man who was staying with his wife together. The woman became pregnant and the husband said, "If my wife can bear me a baby boy I will be very happy" he had hopes that the first child that the wife will give birth to will be a baby boy. The period of giving birth came and the woman gave birth to two girls. The husband said that he thought he would get a boy. And those babies were good they were beautiful, they began growing up with good morals. They grew up and became adults. People used to admire them but they were twins and you could not differentiate. They grew up and the first one was called Waridi and the second one was Zawadi. They were staying and doing home duties well. They could fetch water and do work and their parents especially their mother taught them how to make baskets and mats. They knew how t make them well and people used to come and buy their products. They grew up and people used to admire them.</p>
<p>When they got to the stage of getting married people came and started asking for them. Their father raised the dowry price for them to get married, people used to approach them but when they got to the point of dowry they were astonished with the price. And then they leave and those girls loved each other. Now they were wondering even if they get married, they will get married to the nearest places and they will be meeting and talking. They just stayed like that. Whenever people came to ask for them the father used to give them a high dowry price. Those children were just staying in their house. Now another ogre called Oguri was in the forest and it heard about that, and it asked, "What can I do to get those girls? I will go and try" he took one of his friends and he dressed like a normal tall man. When he came, they were two and they found those girls at their home doing their work. When Zawadi saw him, she fell in love with him and went and told her sister Waridi, "have you seen our husband has come?" and her sister asked her, "which husband?" they got into the house and Zawadi was knitting a mat.</p>
<p>They went and got into the room and they were welcomed. When they were welcomed they stayed inside and the girls were in too. When they got into the room the father saw how they reacted and he guessed that the girl s were attracted to those men, their father called them and asked them to greet the visitors. Those girls greeted them they went back to their room. The father looked at them again and he knew that the two men pleased the girls. The visitors were prepared tea and they took it. </p>
<p>Oguri said that he wanted the two girls, and the father told him the amount of wealth that he expects as dowry, this person gave the dowry that the father wanted and he went. When the girls heard that they were happy and they said, "the wedding day should be near, we get married fast and go" when the neighbors heard that they came and saw that those people had agreed to the dowry that the husband wanted. They organized for their day and after three days many neighbors came to see the girls leaving. And the ogre came with his friend well prepared. Before they left their mother came and gave them a bye and she said, "my children, you are going far and we wont see each other for long, you have been assisting me with work, there is no way that we can use to communicate, you go with this mat and when you have issues, you hit on it and say"</p>
<p>Mat we are hitting you, </p>
<p>Call for us our mother</p>
<p>What can we do to see each other?</p>
<p>Those children went. When they went to that person, they found that he has a big land, that is equipped with things; plants and the wealth was there. The girls said that they had reached to the level that they wanted, "we are now in wealth" they said. Oguri used to do all the tasks and ensure that the food was available at the house. He was flexible at looking for it. He used to look for food and brings it as the girls eat. Within a short period they became fat. After a month they continued growing fat. It reached a point where their husband started leaving the house at night and was not sleeping inside. Whenever they asked him he used to say that he is keeping the safety and watching after the things outside. Zawadi peeped through the window; Oguri had his personal room that they used to serve from his food. He didn't take meals together with his wives. They used to take food there and they find that he has eaten the food. There was a day Zawadi looked through the door and she saw that their husband had turned to an ogre, with double eyes. And it was swallowing the food together with the dishes. Zawadi wondered and she left it for the whole night, and she spent the whole night sorrowful. And she told her sister, "Waridi do you know we are married to an ogre" and the sister told her, "go away, I have seen you for long having a bad mood, your brain is mad" and she told her, "no I am telling you that our husband is no longer a husband we are married to an ogre, I pepped through the door and I saw him having double mouth, it swallows the food. Let us wait for tomorrow we shall go" they waited for him to come and they took the food as usual. Now when they went to look at the room of their husband they found that he was an ogre and she told her, "I told you we are married to an ogre, we are saying that he is a husband and yet he is an ogre" when the girl entered she found those footsteps. When Zawadi saw that she fell down and fainted. The other one carried her and they returned and were okay, they left and went to their room. They stayed there and wondered what they could do.  </p>
<p> "We plan how we can go back home. It is heard we cannot go because it is far, and he will tell other ogres then they stop and catch us, what can we do then?" they wondered. At night they took him the food and peeped through the window, and they saw him swallowing all of those things together with the bowels that he was served food from. Those girls wondered and in the morning they waited when he had left they took the mat that their mother gave them, they sat on it and began to sing:</p>
<p>Mother we are hitting the mat*2</p>
<p>We have reached there</p>
<p>While they were sited on the mat, it began moving up, and then it went on the tree. When the ogre came he wondered what he was seeing. Then he ran to catch the mat, while he was nearing there to catch it started flying. It flew away and the ogre followed it speedily and it imagined how it had paid a lot of dowry, and it wondered how things would be. "All my money? All my wealth?" the ogre imagined. It followed them through the long distance, he ran as he fell down and looked around. When he was almost catching them the mat flew up and went. He ran while looking up to the sky, while he was running there was a river ahead and he fell in, drowned and died. Now those girls returned to their parents. They went and stayed with their parents at first they explained to them how things were and the parents congratulated them and told them, "our children you have done great and arrived here. We are so happy" they stayed there and began doing their work as usual. They began doing their things and their activities, they were told things as they were.</p>
