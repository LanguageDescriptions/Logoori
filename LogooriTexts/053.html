<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Hen and the razor blade</p>
<p>Hen had friendship with the eagle. The hen got children. She saw that her children had long hair that needed to be shaved. She wondered what to do. She remembered her friend and she knew that the friend can assist her with the razor blade. The hen went to borrow razor blade from the eagle. The eagle took the razor blade and gave the hen. Eagle told hen to go and shave her children and when she has finished she return the razor blade back. The hen went and shaved the children and when she finished shaving she kept the razor blade. One of her child went and took the razor blade and it got lost.  </p>
<p>When the eagle came it wanted the razor blade, and he asked the hen to give him the razor blade. The hen looked at where she had kept it but she did not find it. She asked her children but they did not answer back. The eagle said since his razor blade is lost, he will be taking one of her children until the day when she will return the razor blade. That is the reason to why the eagle is still taking away the children of the hen. Because the hen has not given him the razor blade. The day she will give him his razor blade that is the day he will stop taking away her children. </p>
<p>OMUKENYE</p>
<p>Long time ago people used to eat "omukenye" means it is a meal made of beans that are mixed with sweet potatoes. If you ask a child today a child, they cannot define it. And they do not know how to prepare it. I used to see mother taking beans and putting them on the fire, when the beans boils she takes the sweet potatoes and pill them then add to the beans. When the sweet potatoes boil, she could take a cooking stick and mix the beans and the sweet potatoes together to form a thick paste. That is what we call "omukenye" and we do not prepare it because we lack beans and sweet potatoes which are eaten by the moles.</p>
