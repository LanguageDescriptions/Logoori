<p>Kale ligali muno kwali ho na guku wange na kandi guga wange. Guga wange uyu yali yataga mikonye minyinge ligali muno. Kandi yava yataga matemwa manyinge ligali muno. Na guku uyu igasi yeye yalange kutaga tsinjugu vuli kase kase ma kandi yataganga ninde tsimbande. Ku madiku yago guku na guga valange na visukulu vayayi na vakana vamenya navo. Ku guga uyu yaduknda isa yavolelanga avana vayayi yava ndi kalunu kunyi kutsitsa mu chayo; kutsie kwaitsa tsing'ombe tsyitu. Ku yavavolelanga ndi munywe ichai vwangu muvohole tsing'ombe kutsie muchayo. Lwa visukulu vahulilanga guga wavo navavola ndio vakola vwangu vwangu ligali muno kijira eyo yali igasi yavo. Vayayi yava vakola vwangu vwangu ma vavohola tsing'ombe ma vatanga logendo. vatitsanga mu chayo na guga wavo. Na guga wa avana yava yalange mugeli ligali muno; si yali anyala kutsia na vikulu muchayo vujira kuvagingila viukulia dave. Yaginganga viukulia lugano na lugano. Yavagingilanga amaveere kandi na mengu ni viukulia vinde lugano. Ku lwa yaduka isa yu kulia, guga uyu yalanganga avisukulu yava vosi ma yavavolela vatse vikale hasi vanyole viukulia vatumikili mu inzila indahi ligali muno. Ku guga uyu yalange ni igasi ku avana vayayi yava ni kivune ndi yavavolela anoho yavigitsanga kuli vanyala komenya mu lidala. Guga uyu anoho musakulu uyu yigitsanga vayayi yava tsingano nende kuli vanyala komenya na vakana mmbutende. Guga yavavolela ndi yavo na avana vinyu, sio na vakana vo kovolitsa dave. Yavo na avambotso vinyu; mutagwa kirage dave. Ni kivune ndi ni mmbolitsa vakana yava mmbetsa mukola vudamanu ligali muno. Ku vayayi yavavali ni vamanya mima jia guga wavo yavavolela vulu kase. Kandi yavavolela ndi ni wenya kovolitsa mukana kindu chu kutanga oteve mukana ukaveye ihiri ki. Mukana yakakujiba ku umanya kumbe uyu ni musigu. Kijira nutatevi numanyili ki niva ni mwiko wovo. Ku galange malago kutumikila ligali muno. Kandi gakonya vandu ligali muno. Navutsa nuutsa kohenzelitsa mmadiku ga kalunu ni vudinyu ligali muno ni kivune kale vandu valondanga tsihiri navutswa kalunu ni vudinyu sana; si vaveye vosi valonda mba. Kijira madiku ga kalunu vandu vashilananga vutsa vene na vene kali aviko. Icho kivune kijirangavavola vandu valonde mang'ana gali ga kale muno navutsa si ganyalika ku madiku ga kalunu dave. Ni vakutsutsu vakigalonda navutswa vanyinge si vagalonda ligali dave. Ku vasakulu vali va kale vigitsa amigitsu malahi ligali na vaguku vali va kale. Ku guga uyu yatsitsagila kwigitsa visukulu veve mima milahi ligali muno. Yavavolela ndi vatsitsagili kuviluka navutsa vaviluki ni mima milahi ligali. Kandi yavavolela vindu vidamanu ni vindu vilahi navigitsa amang'ana lugano lugano. Navavolelanga vuli kase kase muvetsange avana vageli ni kivune koveye na mang'ana manyinge mu kivala muno. Yadukanga isaa musakulu uyu yavola visukulu yakaduka isaa ya kwenyekana kwilane yengo. Ku lwa isa yaduka, visukulu yava na guga wavo uyu vatanga logendo lwu kwilana yengo ni vatula mu chayo. Ni chayo chavo chosi nuduki kumanya tsing'ombe tsialange ni vatsiha amita lugano na lugano. vatsilanga amita kuli kamwamu, maridadi na gandi lugano lugano. Ku lwa vatanga logendo lwu kwilana yengo, vatajanga tsing'ombe amita ni valonda ku tsimbilu ligali muno. Na kijira guga uyu yali musakulu yavolela vayayi yava kisukulu keke kadidi katigale inyuma vagende nangako nakigitsa kuli vanyala kuva vagenda ni vaveye ni tsing'ombe kijira guga wavo yagenda garaha ni kivune avana yava vali vayanza guga wavo nu mwoyo gwosi ligali muno. Ku vayayi yava vaduka himbe hango, guku lwa yahulilanga ni valanga tsing'ombe amita ga tsio yamanya vatsiyi mu chayo nguyu valagelela. Ku guku uyu yavolela avana vakana mukole vwangu vatsiyi mu chayo mbavo valagelela. Vakana yavo lwa vahulila ndio vadeka viukulia vwangu kuli guku wavo yavavolela. Vadeka viukulia lugano na lugano. Guku uyu lwa yahonga na vakana navo kandi vali ni igasi yavo ya yavahetsa. yavagavulanyila igasi vuli mundu yeye yeye. Vakana yava vali ni vamanya miyinzi ligali muno ni kivune vali vamenya na guku vuli himbe ku shimbe. Ku lwa yago guku yali yavigitsa mima milahi ligali muno. Guku yali yigitsa avakana mima ligali muno kuli vanyala komenya mu lidala anoho kandi yali yavaha malago mang'ana go kovolitsa vayayi mu lidala mutakagwa kirage. Yava na vamwavo vinyu, muve vakana valahi ligali muno. Ku lwa yago vakana yava vahulila amigitsu ga guku yavigitsa mu inzila indahi ligali muno. Nuutsa kolola madiku ga kalunu vakana va kalunu vahulila vivuli mba; mukere niyigitsa vakana va kalunu vavola "mama yive wamala mang'ana gogo, kalunu koveye mu mihiga jinde. Kindiki kikusumbula yive guku." Ni kivune madiku gali ga kale avana vali nu vuti vunyinge ligali ku vivuli vavo navutsa madiku ga kalunu vutii vwa fwa ligali muno.

<p>Kwali ho nu mukaye mula na limenya lilie liali lidinyu ligali muno ni kivune ndi yali natsitsanga kogenda ku lwa yali naduchi mmulitu nu mwana weve. Mukaye uyu vaduka havundu galoleka vaduchi mmulitu na mwana weve uyu natanga kulila navola yenya chukulia. Galoleka mukaye uyu ahenze kuli mwana weve anyala kulia. Lwa yali nagendanga yaduka havundu nahenza igulu na nalola mapera gaveye ku musala igulu. Mukaye uyu yahenza kuli anyala kwagulila mwana weve mapera, yatumikila vogeli navugula lusala ma natanga kwagula mapera tsaba. Lwa mwana uyu yalola mapera yaga yayanza ligali muno ma natsia kuvugula ma natanga kunyanya mwana uyu kijira yahulila inzala ligali muno. Mukaye uyu si yaleka ku kandi logendo lwa yali natsitsa ku dave. Lwa yamala kwagula mapera, yatanga logendo lwilwe navugula mwana weve navika ku mugongo natanga kogenda garaha garaha na nalia mapera nu mwana weve. Ku lwa vatsitsanga mukaye uyu yagenda nagenda vutswa si yaduka wa yatsitsa vwangu mba; galoleka logendo yilu lwali lutambi ligali muno ni kijvune mukaye uyu nu mwana weve vali vamenya hango hu mundu vamulindila ho. Chamanya ni chekoleka, imbura yakuba madiku gene yago ligali muno. Yali imbula yi imbutsa yi migerera na imbura kandi ya magina. Ku gamanya gekoleka mu lidala yilio vandu vamenya mu lidala yilio liosi galoleka tsinyumba tsiavo tsiosi amatsi gakushila. Mukaye uyu yamanya naganaganyia ni yeteva mateva manyinge ligali. Yamanya naganagana ni vurahi ndali na, viko vange havundu, nombe logendo nzie wa vamenya ni kivune tsinyumba tsiavo amatsi gali ni gashiri tsiosi ma ni vatigala avere. Ku vuli mundu yamenyanga mu lidala hene yaho yahenzanga wa anyala kutsia na avana veve vosi kijira ni vatakola ndio ku ni vamenye hayi. Vwali vudinyu ligali kuvo ho komenya. Mukaye uyu yamanya natanga ku ganaganyia ligali muno. Yaduka asubui navugula mwana weve nivatanga logendo lwu kutsia mu viko veve. Na uduki kumanya ndi mukaye uyu yali yatsia yo kale ligali vutswa; yali yamala mihiga minyinge ligali muno niyivilila yo. Mukaye uyu yatsitsagilila logendo lwilwe halala nu mwana weve, ku vaduka havundu ni vanyola mundu yayumbaka kanyumba kakekeke vutswa na nigaloleka sasa mukaye uyu yakuluha ligali muno nu mwana weve uyu ku didi kwa yamuginganga. Mukaye uyu yatanga kuganaganyia navola "sasa isaa ifweye kandi ndakuluha, nyala kokola kindiki?" Ku mukaye uyu lwa yalola inyumba iyi yatsia naduka ku lusimbu ma niyikala ku nu mwana weve. Kijira yali yakuluha ligali muno. Ku chamanya ni chekoleka mukaye uyu yali nanyunyia mwana weve, yalola mundu ni yatsanga naye yali musatsa. Lwa yaduka ahimbe ha vali, yamuteva "mukatula haliki? Muveye vageni anoho mutsitsa haliki?" Na mundu uyu yali naginji vindu vivie mu kikabo. Ku lwa mwana uyu yalola kikabo chu mundu uyu yali naginji nu mwana yatanga kulila ligali natula ku maguru ga mama weve natsia wu mundu oyo yali. Mwana yagelitsa kuhavatitsa ku kikabo tsana ku mundu uyu yali naginji mengu, yamanya navugula liengu lilala naha mwana uyu. Chokogenyia mwana uyu kijira yali ni inzala, yavugula liengu nanyanya vwangu vwangu mama weve yaganaganyia vindu viyninge sana kolondekana ndi mwana uyu yakuba tsikwili mama weve yamanya nalekana naye. Ku mundu uyu yamanya nateva mama wu mwana amuvolele kuli aduchi kunyumba yeyo. Mukaye uyu yivalila mundu oyo tsishida tsia yali natsio kali isaa nimumwamililanga. Mundu oyo yamanya navolela mukaye uyu, inyumba iyi ni yange dave, ku ulalinda mwene niva alakuvugilila wingili mu ulingila mu.

<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Grandfather, grandmother and grandchildren</p>
<p>My name is Linet Mmbone am staying at Jidereri today is 6/5/2014 and I will like to tell you a story about grandfather, grandmother staying together with their grandchildren.</p>
<p>Long time ago I had my grandmother and grandfather. My grandfather had planted many sugarcanes. He had also planted many bananas. The work of my grandmother was to plant groundnuts always and she also planted soya beans. Those days' grandmother and grandfather had their grandchildren that they were staying with. It reached a time grandfather used to inform the boys that they were going for grazing; to go and graze their cows. He used to ask them to take tea very fast they untie the cows and they go for grazing. When the grandsons heard their grandfather saying that they used to do it very fast because that was their work. These boys used to do very fast and then they untie the cows and begin journey very fast. They were going for grazing with their grandfather. And the grandfather of these children was very wise; he could not go with the grandchildren for grazing without carrying them food. He was carrying different types of food. He was carrying for them milk, bananas and other types of food. When it was time for food he used to call his grandsons then they sit down and he shares the food in the right way. Grandfather had work with these boys because he was teaching them how they could stay in the village. Grandfather used to teach these boys stories and how they could saty with their neighboring girls. Grandfather used to tell them that those were their sisters, they wre not girls to chase after. They were their sisters; they should not loose the morals with the reason that it was a mistake if they chased after these girls. These boys knew the behaviours that their grandfather had taught them always. Again he was telling them that if they want to chase after a girl they should ask that the girl be from which tribe. A girl that was not answering then was from an enemy's tribe. Because if you do not ask how will you know that she is your relative. They were laws to be used. They were really assisting people. But today when you look it is difficult because long time ago people were looking at the tribe but today it is difficult; they are not all that follow because these days people are marrying even their relatives. That is the reason to why people are asked to follow the things of the past but it is difficult today. They are few who are following but many are not following. Grandfathers of the past used to pass great teachings and the grandmothers also. This grandfather continued to teach his grandchildren good behaviors. He asked them to continue growing but they grow with good behaviours. He used to tell them bad and good things and he taught them different things. He used to tell that they should always be clever children because there are many things in this world. It reached a time when this man used to tell his grandchildren that it was time to go back home. When it was time these grandsons and their grandfather used to begin the journey to go back home from the grazing place. And at their grazing you should know that all the cows were given names. They were using names like balcky, flowers and other different types. When they were going back home they used to call the cows their names as they ran after them. And because this grandfather was old he used to ask the little grandson to remain behind he walks with him as he taught him how to live. Grandfather was walking slowly with the grandchildren because they loved him with all their heartswhen the grandsons reached near home when their grandfather heard them calling the names of the cows he knew that they had gone to the grazing place and they were now back grandmother used to tell the girls to do very fast since the ones that had gone to the grazing place were back. When the girls heard that they used to cook the food very fast since their grandmother had told them. They were cooking different types of food. When grandmother was with her granddaughters they had work that they were doing. She was dividing work for each of the girls. These girls knew their work because they were staying close to their grandmother. For that reason grandmother had taught them good morals. Grandmother had taught the girls good morals the way they could stay in the village she had taught these girls behaviors and warned them agaoinst chasing after boys because it was a bad behavior. They are their brothers and they should be good girls. For that reason the girls listened to what their grandmother taught them in the best way. These days girls do not listen to their parents; when a woman teaches girls they say "mother you have finished yours, today we are in other years. What is wrong with you grandmother." Because long time children had respect with their parents but today they have no fear. Grandmothers and grandfathers of the past had good teachings and their children were listening too. But these days they do not listen; it is difficult for the children of these days. When you see girls in the past were staying in their house until they get mature enough to get married. And in most cases people used to come and ask for them from their homes because they ahd their respect. These days' girls have problems because they do not listen; that is the reason to why you see our children doing things that they are not supposed to do because they are not listening to the teachigs of the parents. That is the reason to why a child gives birth to another child with thirteen years but long time ago gilrs were giving birth with 30 to 35 years. When you see boys in the village were not chasing after gilrs in the village; they wre fearing because grandfathers and grandmothers used to warn them that those were their sisters. They were not jumping on them but today the world has spoiled everywhere because they do not listen to the teachings of their parents. When you see toady strange things are happening because we have left the teachings of elder men and and elder women. God should come to us in this world everytime because children have disappointed parents and parents have disappointed children. For that reason we should pray God to have mercy on us. When we are living in this world he gives us wisdom.</p>
<p>I also have a story; a girl and the way she was staying with her child</p>
<p>There was a woman and her life was difficult with the reason that she had gone to walk and when she was near the forest. She got to a place in the forest and the child began crying saying that she wanted food. The woman was to look how the child will get food. When she was walking she reached a place and saw that the guavas were on top of a tree. This woman thought of how she could pluck the guavas for her child, she was wise she took a stick and began hitting the guavas and they were sevenwhen this child saw these guavas she was very happy and she went to pick them and eat since she was very hungry. This woman did not stop the journey that she was going. When she finished plucking the guavas she began her journey she took the baby and tied her on her back and she began walking slowly as she ate the guavas with her babywhilke she was walking she continued to walk and she didn't arrive fast where she was going; it appeared thjat the journey was very long and this woman and her child were looking after someones home. What happened is that the rain rained heavily during those days. It was a heavy rain with wind and floods. It appeared that in that village peoples houses were carried away with the floodsthis woman thought and asked her many questions. She remembered that it was nice she had her relatives somewhere, she prepared a journey to where they were staying with the reason that their houses were flooded and they had remained with nothingevry person who was staying in that village thought of where she could go with her children because if they do not do that they won't have a place to live. It was difficult for them because they didn't have a place to stay. This woman began thinking hard. It reached in the morning and she took her baby and began her journey to her relatives. And you should know that this woman had gone there long time ago; she had stayed for many years and forgotten that place. This woman contined her journey together with nher baby, they nreached somewhere and found that someone had made a small house and this woman was very tired with her baby that she was carrying. This woman saw that the time was over and she was tired, she thought of what she could dowhen this woman saw this house she went and sat outside there. Because she was very tiredwhat happened is that this woman was breast feeding her child and she saw someone coming and that person was a man. When he got near where they were he asked them where they were bcoming from and if they were visiting or where they were going. This person was carrying his things in a bagwhen this child saw the man carrying something she began crying and she left her mother and went to the man who was carrying the bag. This child started searching the bag and the man was carrying bananas, he took one banana and gave this child. What happened since this child was very hungry she took the banana and started eating very fast and the mother thought many things because the child was screamingthis man asked the mother how she got to that house. This woman told that man the problems that she had until it was dark at night. That man told that woman that house was not his; she had to wait and see if the woner will allow her to get in. this woman perserviored and waited outside until the owner came. It was very late in the evening and the woman saw an ogre coming. This woman was astonished because the ogre came to where she was but it didn't speak; it entered its house. When ti got into the house it asked whom she was. He told him that when he came he found that woman and the child the ogre took that woman and they entered the house. What happened is that this man and the ogre began preparing their food that they normaly prepare. And you should know that the ogre allowed the woman inside because of her problems. It told her that she will sleep in there but it won't give her it's food. At night this woman was clever because she had kept her guavas that she had plucked. This woman took her guavas and began eating with her baby. The first person who gave that baby a banana thought of how he could assist this woman but it appeared that he had been allowed in the way the woman had been allowed in. it was difficult because the ogre was looking after this woman and the man, it took all the food that it had and went to hide because it felt that this man and the woman were speaking one language (they were agreeing). They slept and it was in the morning. In the morning the woman thanked the ogre and that man. The ogre didn't reply but the man wished her safety jouney. This woman began her journey. She left with her baby and they starte walking. They walked and found a chimpanzee on tree. This chimpanzee was looking for food its children. It happened that this chimpanzee droped the maize that it was carrying. That woman picked the maize since she was hungry and she kept them in her bag and continued with her journey and they went. They reached somewhere and saw smoke coming out of it. What this woman did is that she kept her baby down. And because this woman was very hungry she took her maize and began roasting them. When she had finished roasting the maize she sat down with her baby and they started eating the maize. When they were eating the maize it chocked her baby. It appeared that there was no water near and this mother took her breast and began breast feeding her. But what happened is that this baby did not stop getting chocked she continued. This woman continued wondering. She took her baby and put her on her back then she started her journey. She walked very fast back to where she was coming from because she saw that there was a small river. This woman reached where the river was and she scooped the water using her hand and she gave it to her baby; she thought of many things but God returned to her differently this woman was not tired with her journey. She took her baby and kept her on her back and then she began her journey. She walked and then she reached somewhere and sat down. When she sat down she thought and she saw the shops and thought that she had reached near where she was heading to. She stood where she was and she felt it was good because she was almost near where she was going. She looked ahead and she saw the road that she was using. While she was walking she reached somewhere and saw a very big hole. She continued to walk but when she got near where that hole was she realized that she was so afraid. This woman began walking very slowly and when she reached near the hole she heard the frogs making a lot of noise. There was a small river there and when she crossed she found two men standing on top of a hill, she told them that shge was lost and it was many years those men asked her where shge was going to and she told them that she was going to her grandmother those men showed her the way and she started her journey there slowly. When she got to the gate she saw a woman and tried to compare her to her grandmother. The grandmother asked her who she was and she laughed and then she told her "it is me your granddaughter I have stayed for many years without meeting you." Grandmother welcomed her inside the house and then she asked her, "What is wrong with you?" that woman replied to her grandmother and told her,"thank you for welcoming me to your home all the work that you will be having you should know today that you have found a worker." This woman began staying with her grandmother in the right way. She used to wake up every morning and goes to the river when she was going to the river the chief of that village used to ring a bell every day at 5.00. This woman had been given instructions by the grandmother about the laws that chief had set and were to be followed. With the reason that when this chief rang the bell everyone was to go to the river and fetch water because after some time the river was closed. All the people had known the time wellthis woman used to get up very early in the morning; she takes her pot and goes to the river. When she was going she met very bad enemies. They took her very fast and carried her away very fast. And because they had tied her mouth and she could not scream. This grandmother waited for her granddaughter but she didn't see her. Mthis woman wondered and at 9 AM she went to the river. Grandmother met another girl and asked her if she met her granddaughter at the river. That girl told her that at that time there was no one at the river, with the reason that the chief gave instructions that at 8AM the river should be closed. When this grandmother heard that she felt like her blood stopped moving. This grandmother when she heard that she felt that she had to go there and confirm if she was told the truth it happended that the ogre had asked the woman where she was going. And the small child that she was carrying she was going with her where that ogre followed her where she was going, she didn't know that it was following her. What happened is that the ogre took the body of that woman and went to hide in a hole. It reached in the morning when it went to look there and then it starts to sing:</p>
<p>It is I the ogre*2</p>
<p>I was walking on the way</p>
<p>I found a meat*2</p>
<p>The grandmother of the woman every night she used to hear someone singing outside. This grandmother used to wake up and then she listen and says "isn't that the voice of my girl who used to fetch water for me from the river?" this grandmother wondered and she continued to live, she slept and after two days she hear the voice of someone singing in the midnight. This grandmother was stressed because her granddaughter went to the river and she never came back. The ogre had taken her and finished her, it was grateful because it was eating the meat that it had taken slowly by slowly my story teaches that in times of trouble we should be clever in the world that we are living in. thank you.</p>
