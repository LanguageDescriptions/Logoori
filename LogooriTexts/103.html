<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">A woman, elephant and hare</p>
<p>I have a story about a woman, four elephants and hare. We had a woman who had a big farm that she liked planting on calabash. One day she went to plant calabash on her farm. When she planted the calabash they did well, many calabash grew. While in the forest the elephants were moving around and looking for what they can feed on. While they were walking they found the calabash and they started feeding on the calabash. They fed on and left. The following day the woman came to check on her calabash the way they are moving on. She found that the elephant had eaten the calabash, she returned home.</p>
<p>The following day she came and found that the elephant had fed on. The third time she came she also found hare. She told the hare that the elephants are feeding on her calabash. She asked him what she could do so that the elephants do not feed on the calabash. The hare laughed and told her it was simple. He promised to solve the issue for her and the elephants won't eat the calabash again. She asked the hare what to do. The hare asked her to bring a knife and then go to the farm and bring a large calabash. She gave him the knife, then she went to the farm and hare asked her to keep the calabash at a place where the elephants normally pass. The hare took the knife and made a hole inside the calabash and entered inside and kept quiet. The woman went back home and the elephants came and started eating very fast. One of the elephants swallowed the calabash that the hare had hid inside. While the others were eating they had something saying "it is you who finish my calabash, it is you who finish my calabash" those elephants ran away very fast and they reached at a point and they heard it speak again "it is you who finish my calabash, it is you who finish my calabash" they ran away and got tired. They decided to stop and see what was happening.</p>
<p>They stopped and decided to arrange themselves in a line. They heard the voice again "it is you who finish my calabash, it is you who finish my calabash" they asked themselves what to do and they found out that the voice was coming out from one of the elephants. They agreed to kill one of the elephants so that they find out what was making noise inside the elephant. They took the elephant and killed it. When they killed it they found hare inside. They said "it is you who is making us run, we want to kill you" the hare pleaded with them not to kill him. They asked the hare to eat the elephant meat and finish it. The hare agreed to do it but he asked them to allow him to go and look for firewood so that he could roast the meat and eat. They allowed him to go and look for firewood. He went and looked for firewood. While he was putting the firewood together he saw hyena. He asked hyena if he wanted meat and hyena told him how he had moved around the forest without finding anything to eat. He asked him to carry the firewood so that he could show him where the meat is. Hyena loaded the firewood on his back and he followed hare. They went and hare showed hyena the meat and asked hyena to eat. The hyena agreed to eat.</p>
<p>The hare took the firewood and ran away. The hyena ate the whole meat, when it finished it was thirsty it went to drink water. It took a lot of water and the stomach busted and it died. My story has ended there.</p>
<p>HEN AND HAWK</p>
<p>There was a time when hen and hawk were great friends. God blessed them with children and they were going out to look for food for their children. They used to look for food together because they were friends. One day the hawk told hen that it wanted to go out for a wedding ceremony. The hawk asked the hen to accompany her together with their children. The hen agreed and the following day the hen went to visit the hawk and told her that her children had long nails. She borrowed a razor blade and the hawk took razor blade and gave her.</p>
<p>The hen cut her children nails, and then a visitor came in. The hen left the razor blade to the children and she entered inside to talk to the visitor. She spoke with the visitor for long and the children decided to play with the razor blade. The visitor left the home and the hen went outside to finish cutting the children nails. She found that her children had lost the razor blade and it was nowhere to be found. The hawk came on to take the hen out for wedding ceremony. The hen hid herself, the hawk looked for her but she did not find her. Hawk went to the wedding ceremony alone. When the wedding was over, she came back to hen's place and found her. She told her that she came to pick her but she hid herself. She asked her to give back her razor blade since her children had long nails also. The hen told her that she gave her children the razor blade and it got lost. The hawk told the hen that it will be taking one chick from her every day until the day that she will return her razor blade. That is the reason to why the hen is always searching for it every day, she wants to find the razor blade. My story ends there.</p>
<p>KEFOYO, LIKUDU NA LINYONYI </p>
<p>Hare, tortoise and bird were great friends. One day they sat down and had a talk. The bird told the tortoise and the bird that it was invited somewhere for a party and asked them to accompany him. They asked him where they were going for the party. The bird told them that she wanted them to take her to a wedding on the moon. The tortoise and hare told the bird that they do not have wings to fly. The bird told them that she will give them her wings but when they come back they give the wings back to her. The bird gave the wings to them; before they left they gave themselves names. The tortoise named himself All and the hare Visitor and the bird Departure. They went and arrived at the place of visit.</p>
<p>They started the ceremony and finished it. They wanted meals. When the cooks wanted to serve meals they asked all of them to take the meals and since all was a name that belonged to tortoise he went and took the meal alone and denied others. They waited and another meal came and all stood and went to take the meal. When it was dark and they wanted a place to rest the tortoise stood and went to sleep alone. He slept while his friends were sitting. They wondered what to do and the bird told the hare to be patient. The following morning tea and bread was prepared and kept on the table, and all went and ate the meal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The bird told tortoise to share the meals since they were starving and we were with you. The tortoise told them that while they were naming themselves he asked them to take all as their name and they refused. The bird told the tortoise that while they will be going home he will have to return her wings. When time came the tortoise returned the wings and pleaded with the bird to tell his wife to take mattresses and blankets and put them out he will jump from the sky and fall on them. The bird agreed to do so and when she arrived at tortoise home she told tortoise wife that tortoise had sent her to ask his wife to put sword, spade and iron sheets outside he was coming. The wife took those things and put them outside. The tortoise came from the sky and fell on those items and broke his body. Those things cut his body and that is the reason to why the tortoise has scars all over the body. My story has ended there.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A WOMAN AND GIRLS</p>
<p>There was a woman who had five girls. One of the girls was lazy. One day she asked her to go with her to the farm to dig. She refused and said that she was sick. She went and slept and others went to dig. The woman took milk and fermented it in a gourd. They went to the farm and when they returned back to cook food they found that the girl had taken the milk and drank it then she added in water. When they came they baked maize flour and they asked the sick child to bring the fermented milk on the table. The girl said that she was unable to since she was sick. One of the girls went and brought the gourd, and when they poured into cups they found out that it was water.</p>
<p>The woman told them that she had fermented milk and not water. She asked the girls who went to the farm with her if they drank the milk and they said no. she asked the sick girl and she said that she did not get up. They agreed to go the river and arrange themselves in a line and sing a song as they cross. The girl who drank the milk was the last one. One of the girls began.</p>
<p>It is not me, it is not me</p>
<p>Who drank the milk x2</p>
<p>I am crossing once saying that I did no drink the milk</p>
<p>My in law has lied that it is me</p>
<p>She crossed then another one came:</p>
<p>It is not me, it is not me</p>
<p>Who drank the milk x2</p>
<p>I am crossing once saying that I did no drink the milk</p>
<p>My in law has lied that it is me </p>
<p>She crossed and the third one came:</p>
<p>It is not me, it is not me</p>
<p>Who drank the milk x2</p>
<p>I am crossing once saying that I did no drink the milk</p>
<p>My in law has lied that it is me</p>
<p>She crossed and the fifth one came and started to sing:</p>
<p>It is not me, it is not me</p>
<p>Who drank the milk x2</p>
<p>I am crossing once saying that I did no drink the milk</p>
<p>My in law has lied that it is me </p>
<p>When she crossed she fell in water, she died in water and the others returned home. My story has ended there.</p>
