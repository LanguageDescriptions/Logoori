<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">When a woman gave birth</p>
<p>Long time ago when a woman gave birth, those people didn't have towels for holding in the babies. A woman used to carry the baby in a cloth that she had on her body. Now if the baby peed on her laps she used to seek assistance from another child who is older than that baby. And they used to look for another clever child that they can send. Those who didn't give birth to babies after a short while they were not lucky. They used to send that child to go and bring a leaf for wiping the pee. We had another stick called "livuya" it had something called "vugagayo" That one removed all the pee from the cloth and the other one was called "kitalandalwa" it had some things that sprouted on it. At first they were black and when they ripe they were red. That is what those women used for removing the pee from the clothes if the child has peed on their clothes. They didn't give birth from hospitals they did it from their homes. They used to say that if a woman gives birth you cook for her, some sort of vegetables called "nderema" so that the breast milk can come down for the child to suck. Those people were like that. That is how people in the past used to give birth to their children. It has reached there.</p>
