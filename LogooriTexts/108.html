Lwene yilu lugano lwakubila mundu ndio; vavola mwana wa vuyu akola ndi akola ndi; ma mundu akuba lugano yilu.</p>

<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Maragoli proverbs</p>
<p>I want to say the maragoli proverbs. These ones were told to people but they had hidden meaning.</p>
<p>Do not play on the stone, the stone is hot: it was showing that someone could look down upon another person without knowing how energetic that person is. You can do that to a person and you find that person has taken you to a tough place.</p>
<p>The clever one ends up at the roof: people liked doing their things in secret. But these things happen in open because there is no secret fro one person.</p>
<p>Gluttonous person has heard fire: this is a person who is never contended with the food given, he wants to eat this, that and eats without getting contended. A person like that was known to eat while standing and if he said he was contended they used to clap for him with this proverb.</p>
<p>Do not look at your old mother and say that father threw away cows: like the present days when children look at their old mothers and fathers they look down upon them. They say that they do not have anything that they are saying and they do not remember that they were once young boys and girls. It means that when these men and women were still young they didn't do what the young people do these days.  </p>
<p>Mbiushukane burned the mouth: this proverb was told to someone who liked speaking carelessly. Some people listen to words then they rush to tell others. They were told this to let them know that when you hear something do not rush,, you wait and see where it is coming from and where it is going. </p>
<p>A white woman smells bad: this one was told to people that, you should not look at someone's skin and you say that she is a good person. Most of the people look at the white people and they say that they are competent. "kevove" is behavior. Their skin is not the same as their behaviors that is the reason to why they were saying this proverb.</p>
<p>You are burning, you will eat with the vegetables: they were saying that you are burning referring to baked maize flour and vegetables. It is not the baked maize flour and vegetables that people eat. This proverb was referring to why someone engages in issues that he/she won't achieve anything out of them. Whenever someone went to spread rumors to another person she was told this proverb. I do not want your issues am not interested.</p>
<p>A cheetah eats it's intestines: this is an animal that lives in the forest even though there are some that stay with them in their houses and they know what they do with them. It means that the young one of a cheetah has the same characters as the cheetah. Hence you find the child has the same character as the father and mother. This proverb was told to someone like that. They used to say the son of someone is doing this and then he is told that proverb.</p>
<p>The one that is piercing me today could have pierced me tomorrow: this is when someone had a good day he/she wishes that he could have had the same, the following day.</p>
<p>The one that you are eating you do not sleep with it: this one was told to someone who is thinking of where he/she can get food. What shall I do; he was told this proverb to know that the day is still early, your luck is coming and it can find you any time even when the night has not come.</p>
<p>You are defeated to dance; wait I pull the cloth: this one was told to the lazy people. There are some people when they go the farm they say that the tool they are using is not digging well; if I had another tool it could have dug well. When told to do a certain job he says; ah ah if you gave me another job I could have done it well. It was told to the lazy people. "Kuvina" is to dance with the cloth that you have kept on. When he is defeated to dance he can say that he could have danced well but the cloth is long and it has confused him. This is a person who likes giving excuses for the work that he has not done.</p>
<p>The long that I have stayed the tree has never grown swaa: this one was told to mean people, one who cannot give you anything. Now when she gives you wonder what made her to give you. Or someone who does not give then she promises that on a certain day she will give you. Such person is told this proverb. It is showing that you are promising to give me something that you won't fulfill.</p>
<p>The one who grind the flour for mother eats: this one is very true. If someone is grinding flour that person cannot sleep like that. When someone is given work to do he has to eat there. This one shows that when someone was given work to do, he began doing it and saying the one who grind the flour for mother eats.</p>
<p>A proverb is said to the one who knows it: someone who doesn't know proverbs cannot be told things then he understands the meaning.</p>
<p>A potter eats from the place of pottering: an example is someone who makes pot. When you go to his home, you will find that he is modeling pots as he sells and in his house he doesn't have any pot. Or a masonry who build good house for people and when you go to his home he doesn't have any good house, or he doesn't have a house. There are many handcraft people, like the one who make seats, tables and beds. He can make them for people and sell at a good high price. But when you go to his house you can stand because he doesn't have any seat to sit on. You can sleep on a sack because he doesn't have a bed. What he does for other people is not the same as what he does for himself.</p>
<p>The one on water sleeps thirsty: you can find someone is near where he can find help, but people from far come and get that help and he arrive late. That is the reason to why this proverb is said. </p>
<p>The firewood that is on the roof is laughing at the one on the fire: many people gather firewood and keep them on the roof and then they remove them and put on fire for cooking. It means that the firewood that is on the roof is laughing at the one that is on fire. This proverb was told to people who liked the negative side of someone else. And he forgets that he also has the bad issues. This proverb is the same as this; the ones operated laughs at their wounds. You can see someone's issues, maybe the children are thieves, they are not learning and you are saying that and maybe yours are also disturbing you. It means that you are laughing at someone else and you have the same problem. The ones operated laughs at their wounds.</p>
<p>Those are the proverbs that I liked to say today we will, continue another day.</p>
