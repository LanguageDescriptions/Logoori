<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Hare and a warthog</p>
<p>I have a story about hare and warthog.</p>
<p>Hare and warthog were great friends and they loved one another. They were doing their work together. They used to go to hunt together. The warthog had a woman and the hare also had his mother. They used to go to hunt and they brought what they had hunt to their mothers. One day they went to hunt and when they hunted they found an animal and killed it then they brought it to their mother. They also did the same on another day and they brought it. They loved one another and after giving their mothers the meat they used to light fire in the evening. One day they went to hunt and they didn't find anything.</p>
<p>They went to the forest and came back in the evening without finding anything. When they had light up the fire the warthog asked the hare "we have gone to hunt and we have not found anything, what do you think we should do?" the hare asked him to return there on the following day they see if they can hunt and get something. The following day they went to hunt but they didn't find anything and they returned home. They went to warm themselves on the fire and they told themselves that they had not found anything. The warthog told the hare that they go to the market to see if people can be sold. The following day they went to the market. While they were walking they heard a man callng and saying that he was selling people. The warthog went and asked him "we have our people if we bring them to you will you buy them" the old man told them that he will buy them, because he is the one who buy people in this place. They left the market place as they spoke to one another. The warthog asked the hare, shall we go and tell our mothers that we want to sell them.</p>
<p>The hare suggested that they make coffins. After they have made coffins they will go to sell them. They made their coffins, the hare went with his coffin home. The warthog also went with his coffin home. The warthog took his mother and kept her in the coffin then he locked her in. the hare went and took stones and placed them inside very well. They accompanied each other and they went. They went and arrived at the market. When they were there they went to the place where the old man was and they told him that they had brought our people they are here. He told them that he wanted to open the box and confirm if they had put in people. He opened the box for the warthog and found in the woman. When he wanted to open the one that belonged to the hare, the hare refused and told him not to open his mother is sleeping inside and when they open, the mother will start screaming and she will run away. They should just leave her inside. </p>
<p>They were given money and the old man took the coffins. They left the place happily and they went home as they spoke to one another. They went to the place where the fire was, they ate what they had bought and the hare, took the money that he had and gave the mother. When the mother cooked the food, the hare went and ate it, while the warthog ate all the money that he had. When he finished the money that he had he told him that his money was over and he asked him what to do. They were sitting near the fire and the hare suggested that they should go to hunt. They went to hunt and they found something to eat. One day they went to hunt but they didn't find anything to eat. The warthog went home and slept without eating anything. The hare went and knocked where the mother was and she openned. The hare ate and returned where they were. The hare did that again. They went to hunt again and they didn't find anything the hare went and his mother openned the door, he ate and returned to the place where he was staying with the warthog. The warthog asked him where he was eating from since he was fat. The hare said that he normaly take water and stays like that. the warthog said that hunger was killing him. One day the warthog said that he wanted to see why hare was growing fat and where he was eating from since he had emaciated. After hunting without finding anything, he followed the hare slowly as he hide himself at a place where the hare could not see him. The hare knocked the corner and his mother opened the door and the hare entered inside. The warthog ran away vert fast so that the hare could not find him.</p>
<p>The hare ate and went away. The warthog asked him "Ae*(Means no) hare you seem to have a place where you are eating, you seem to have cheated me. You have your mother" the hare told him "Ae I sold my mother, I do not have a mother I am also hungry" the following day the warthog asked the hare to go and hunt. The warthog hide himself from the hare and he went to the home of hare and knocked the door. When the woman looked from a distance she realized that it was not her child. She didn't open the door. The warthog ran very fast and the hare asked him where he was coming from. The warthog said that he had come to hunt from the other side and that is why he didn't see him. The following day the warthog hide himself from the hare and he knocked the door and the woman openned the door. When she openned the warthog jumped on her. When he ate the meat, he went and hide himself at his home. He ran to the forest. and asked the hare "You have not received anything?" and the hare said "Yes I haven't received anything" he told him that he was lookin for one but he has not received any. He asked him how they were going home. He told him that they were going to be well. On the way they went to different directions, the hare went to his home, and the warthog went to his home too.</p>
<p>When the hare arrived at home, he saw blood and wondered where the blood was coming from? "it seems like my mother is dead." He knocked at the door but nobdy openned. He pushed the door. When he entered inside the house he saw blood and when he looked up where his mother used to hide, he was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>He asked himself what to do. The hare was sorrowful. He went and asked the warthog to light fire for them to warm their bodies. When they were warming their bodies the hare was mourning. The warthog asked him why he was crying, the hare said that he was not crying it was smoke that was making him to shed a few tears from the eyes. The hare wondered what to do, he took the fire and started lighting the warthog's tail without his acknowledgement. The warthog began to burn and he told the hare that he was getting burnt but the hare said "no you are not burning that is a spark that seems to have jumped on you, you are not burning" the fire continued to burn the warthog and he ran and threw himself in water but the water had dissappeared. He also moved to another place of water and before he threw himself inside the fire was already over his body. And he died. My story has ended there. </p>

<p>There was a woman who had her daughter. This woman stayed for many years without receiving any child. God blessesd her and she got a child. When she got the child she loved her very much. The child grew up very fast and she was a girl. She was a child that could be sent somewhere, to go and look for firewood, to go and fetch water. One day she prepared herself to go and look for firewood. The woman asked her to prepare herself they will be going to look for firewood. They went to the forest to look for firewood. They went to the forest and they looked for their firewood. The girl saw some fruits on the tree and she told her mother that she had seen the fruit and they were hungry. They asked themselves who was to climb on that tree. The mother asked her to climb on the tree since she was a child. The child refused and said that if she climbed on the tree she would fall down and she asked the mother to climb on it. The woman said that she will struggle and climb on the tree. She climbed the tree and she started plucking the fruits. The child asked her to pluck for her the fruit that was ripe. The woman plucked it and she dropped down for her to pick it. She showed her another ripe fruit and she asked her to pluck it, she plucked and dropped it down for her. </p>
<p>The girl told her that when she want to come down, she should leave one leg hunging on the tree. One hand should hang on the tree. And also one of the breast should hung on the tree. When the woman wanted to come down these things got stuck on the tree. The woman screamed wondering how she could get down but she didn't manage. The girl cut the tree down and took the mother and wrapped her inside the cloth that she had and she carried her on the head. While she was walking towards home she met the ogre and the ogre asked her what she was carrying. The girl began to sing:</p>
<p>I am carryng my mother</p>
<p>Inside this basket*2</p>
<p>The ogre asked her to put the basket down so that he could confirm. She kept the body down then she cut off the hand and gave the ogre. She walked and met another ogre that asked her what she was carrying and the girl began to sing:</p>
<p>I am carryng my mother</p>
<p>Inside this basket*2</p>
<p>The ogre asked her to put the basket down. And cut off the leg She kept the body down then she cut off the leg and gave the ogre. She walked and met another ogre that asked her what she was carrying and the girl began to sing:</p>
<p>I am carryng my mother</p>
<p>Inside this basket*2</p>
<p>The ogre asked her to put the body down and cut for him. She moved ahead and met other fie ogres and they asked her what she was carrying, if she doesn't put t down they will eat her. The girl began to sing:</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am carryng my mother</p>
<p>Inside this basket*2</p>
<p>They asked her to put it down for them to see. These ogres took the body that was remaining and they shared and ate it. They took the thing that the girl had put in the moter, they gave the girl and asked her to go home. The girl walked away and when she was almost arriving home, she met another ogre that asked her what she was carrying and she said:</p>
<p>I am carryng my mother</p>
<p>Inside this basket*2</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ogre asked her to put it down so that he can see. And the other ogres had eaten the body and what was remaining inside was blood. the ogre salivated and the girl took the basket and went home. When the girl arrived at home the other girls asked her "you went to look for firewood together with your mother, where have you left her?" and she said "mother was just in the forest, even I don't know where she went, she got lost" they told her that she was with her mother and she knows where her mother went. She refused and said that she was not with her mother. The girl stayed in the house alone. She didn't see where to go and look for food. Hunger killed her in that house. My story has ended there.</p>
<p>EASTER SONGS</p>
<p>Under the tree I reached to stand there</p>
<p>Through the walk with good shade</p>
<p>Truely in my heart I have stood</p>
<p>I will accept all my iniquities when the sun is shining</p>
<p>It is a good place the fence is strong</p>
<p>The place has real joy</p>
<p>The way Jacob saw in the past age</p>
<p>The cross and the way to heaven</p>
<p>Jesus was sentenced to death  because of me, when I was lost</p>
<p>I was astonished because of the two things</p>
<p>The way he loved me before I knew him</p>
<p>You want to meet with Jesus in heaven</p>
<p>The road is towards the cross</p>
<p>The saviour is there and he is seated with another one</p>
<p>He also had joy together with the king</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You read the story of the cross where Jesus died</p>
<p>He paid much debt through his blood</p>

<p>Those that read are keeping Jesus</p>
<p>He prayed for forgiveness</p>
<p>Have you read the way he saved the thief who was on a tree</p>
<p>The one who looked at him in humility, he said remember me</p>

<p>He died because of our sins</p>
<p>He had mercies he died for the sinners</p>
<p></p>
