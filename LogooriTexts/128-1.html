<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Circumcision and culture</p>
<p>My name is Henry Munangwe and I will like to talk about how our people came to practice the things that they do. I will talk about the circumcision and the age group the way I have thought and made according to the lifestyle of the Maragoli.</p>
<p>The rules of the circumcision from the first to the last on we start with the "Imbalabala" moving ahead to "Viana" the coming of Christianity caused some cultural practice to be removed because they were not good. Some of the cultural practices that were removed were those that were not moving hand in hand with the laws of the new religion. Some of the circumcision names are named after the thing that had happened in the world during that season. Some of the names were given because of the things that were there. The ones that are known during tha years that they happened are 11 from the older one "Kijedi" moving ahead to the younger ones. The 22 ones began with "Libwoni" moving back to the older circumcisions to "Nyongi" but the 13 circumcision began with "Angaya" moving behind to the "Kwekoya" they are not known the way they were following each other. The names of the circumcision were written down beginning with the ones that were known to be older than the others.</p>
<p>And it was in line with the ones that is the younger ones of all. We are figuring out the years between one circumcision season and the other one among the older ones. The difference of years between 20 and 30 were allocated to the first circumcision which was "Libwoni" moving back to "Kwekoya" the older circumcision periods were waiting because of certain different reasons. Some of the reasons were because of war among different tribes. Sometimes it was because of the shortage of food in the world. Sometimes it was because the initiates were few because of low rate of birth and high rate of death. Such reasons caused the initiates to wait for one another and they were caused to wait. The age difference between the circumcision periods was 20 to 30. The 22 circumcisions began with "Libwoni" moving back to "Kwekoya" and they happened between the 22 and 30 that have passed. And it totals to these years 440-660 that passed. Most of the maragoli emphasized that the circumcision of "Libwoni" season was in the year 1900. Before getting to these years 440-660 from 1900 moving backwards and it happens that the years that were between 1240 and 1460 that these circumcision were held. They reached when the Maragoli were staying in the west. There were some circumcisions that the names were forgotten. If remembered they can move these years back to 1000.</p>
<p>Kwekoya</p>
<p>This is the circumcision that is believed to be the first one. It was the first one among the older ones that can be remembered as Maragoli circumcision. It is said that the age group of "Kwekoya" were circumcised when the Maragoli were staying on the boundary of Kenya and Uganda on the hill of Tororo. Some of the Maragoli were staying in Kenya and others were staying in Uganda. Before the initiator began to circumcise the initiates first went to look for "Itsirundu" for holding on the head when they will be circumcised. When the initiates of the "Kwekoya" age group went to look for "itsirundu" that they were sent to look for they stayed there for long without coming back fast. When they came back with the "itsirundu" that they were sent to bring they were summoned and asked, "you were sluggish where and you were sent for itsirudu long time ago?" when the elders wanted to name it. They named them "Kwekoya"</p>
<p>Kigwamiti/Kikwamiti</p>
<p>This is among the maragoli circumcisions that were recognized but the meaning of the name Kigwamiti has not been known. It sounds like Kalenjin. This is the second circumcision after Kwekoya. People are saying that Bukusu also used this name in their circumcision. Other meaning has not been known about this circumcision age group.</p>
<p>Sohe</p>
<p>The name that is in maragoli is to "kusoha" means something that is growing without shaking or growing up well. A person with impure blood went or moved by then the wheat shake and it's produce was not in surplus. The Maragoli used to reason and thought that it was a person with impure blood who caused it. If this circumcision was named as "Sohe" then the body of the initiates might have been shocked or stressed because of a certain reason. Then the people thought that the initiates were fearful. This might be the reason to why this circumcision was called "Sohe" other things about this circumcision are not known. </p>
<p>Makulungenge</p>
<p>The meaning of Makulungenge was not known. It doesn't sound like a maragoli word. It sounds like a name of the things that were crawling, or staying in water or flying. They are like "viguguli" in mentioning it sounds like the name of "viguguli" that stays in the ocean. It seems like this circumcision was there when the things called "Makulungenge" were many in the world.</p>
<p>Vutsilili</p>
<p>It is thought to be the fifth circumcision. Coldness and the young ones of "tsisige" during this circumcision "tsisige" were many in the world. It was also named after the hunger that was in maragoli. </p>
<p>Lumbadadia</p>
<p>The term lumbadadia looks like it was showing the dryness of the world when this circumcision was there. Maybe the sun had burned the grass and it had dried. If the world was in such condition then it means that there was no more food in the world, during that time. In most cases the initiation was there during the season of food. Maybe this initiation was when the world was dry and there was no much food. The name lumbadadia has been named after a hunger that was once in Maragoli. </p>
<p>Munanatsi/Gamunanatsi</p>
<p>Some people call this initiation as Munenetsi or Gamunenetsi. This name sounds as Kalenjin. In other thoughts this name is portraying initiates of this circumcision were huge or mature. Nothing else is known beyond this about this circumcision.  </p>
<p>Ngulungulu</p>
<p>The name Ngulungulu of this initiation sounds like it was showing a big thing. Maybe this age group the initiates were circumcised when they are much older. Maybe this can be among the initiation when the initiates were circumcised together with their fathers. Beyond that more is not known about this initiation.</p>
<p>Mang'ure/Gimang'ure</p>
<p>The ninth initiation in Maragoli the maragoli of long time ago had the saying of stories about the past it was about questions and answers that sounded like names. One was asking and the other one was answering like this:</p>
<p>Your father is who</p>
<p>A Tonde</p>
<p>Tonde mang'ure</p>
<p>A mang'ure</p>
<p>Mang'ure ngwegwe</p>
<p>A ngwegwe</p>
<p>Ngwegwe vayanza</p>
<p>A vayanza</p>
<p>Vayanza vatwa</p>
<p>A Vatwa</p>
<p>Vatwa vagavo</p>
<p>A vagavo</p>
<p>Vagavo ninga</p>
<p>A ninga</p>
<p>Ninga tsatsa</p>
<p>A tsatsa</p>
<p>Tsatsa mmbo</p>
<p>A mmbo</p>
<p>Mmbo kavili</p>
<p>A kavili</p>
<p>Kavili nyambula</p>
<p>A nyambula</p>
<p>Nyambula gibi</p>
<p>Masia ku vulalo</p>
<p>All the names are coming from Tonde to Masia are twelve. Sound like nine names among them were names of people. And the three of them are names of the tribe of people. Eleven names from Tonde up to Nyambula it seems like they are following them while they were on one side of their life. From Nyambula the following thing is the action of sending the answer. The one who followed Nyambula was Masia who stood at the twelfth position. And he was on vulalu. The questions and the answers didn't find someone who could give their meanings. If these names were mentioned it is according to the names of the Valogoli. The name of Ndimi was not mentioned in them. When Masia was coming from vulalu, he was coming from where. And he crossed and went where. We are getting back to the initiation. It is said that the name Mang'ure was there during the season of questions and answers and it was said in plural as Mbitila. Maybe the name Mang'ure had a certain habit when this initiation was there and it was named as Mang'ure.</p>
<p>Save/Isave</p>
<p>Save or Isave it sounds like it was a name of someone. Many things about this initiation are not known but it seems like the age group was named after a person who had a certain habit during the initiation. Or he was circumcised having more years than all the others. </p>
<p>Luse</p>
<p>The ones that were named during this initiation they were named after a person who had a certain habit when that initiation was taking place.</p>
<p>Kiguliesi</p>
<p>Some of the maragolis haven't emphasized on having this name among the names of initiation. The name Kiguliesi sounds to be near the maragoli name of Kuguliesana or kuguyesana. Maybe the initiates during this circumcision were shaking or they were walking as they shake and that's why they were given the name.</p>
<p>Angaya</p>
<p>The thirteenth initiation in Maragoli the ones given the name were also named after a person. Maybe Angaya had a certain habit when this initiation was on. The 13 intitiation were starting from Kwekoya to Angaya they are not known well the way they are following each other in the elderly manner. But according to this it is thought to be near due to its old age.</p>
