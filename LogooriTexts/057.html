<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">People who are fighting</p>
<p>Eeeeeeh I want to say this:</p>
<p>I want to talk about preventing people who are fighting or quarrelling in a village that they are staying in. If people are fighting to the point that they need to be assisted, if you are near and you want to assist them you should be careful. If people are fighting or quarrelling in a village, you should analyse and get to the point of understanding why are they quarrelling. If they are fighting you should know what they are carrying in their arms. Do not rush there thinking that you are going to assist them. Because they can turn against you and cut you until you loose your life from this world. And when you are going there you should be in a group, in order to assist those people who are fighting.</p>
<p>If they are people from the same homestead, you will call people from the village to come and solve the issue or the case that they were fighting and quarrelling over. And if the village has been deafetaed and the people who were fighting are christians, they should then be taken to their church elders to work on their case. If they are defeated they will be taken to the village elders. If the village elders are defeated, they push the case forward to the sub chief. If the sub chief will be able to finish the case he/she will do it and if he/she is defeated he will push it forward to the police station. At the police station the police will take these people to the court.  </p>
<p>Once they have been taken to the court, their case will be solved and finished by the judge. He will ask them to explain the reason to why they quarrelled, they should then receive their recommendation report from the sub-chief to the police, then to the judge. If they are found guilty, they will find themselves in jail. And if they are not found guilty they will be given a warning and released to return to their village. And they won't fight again another day or quarrel. People quarreling in a village attract fight and disagreements. </p>
<p>So you are supposed to be careful with the person who is fighting the other one if you are able to separate them from the fight. Because the fight can land on you until you get a scar where you are. The leaders should be like that or we should be like that inorder to prevent people from fighting in the village. If you fight in the village you will be causing trouble and people should not fight in the village. And also if we see the women disagreeing in a village the people in th homestead should be able to solve and finish the issue.</p>
<p>They should be taken to the church and solve their issues from there, but they should not be taken to the office of the law, because the issues of a homestead are solved traditionaly. Then it is finished, then they forgive each other and they stay together in peace. I believe that is the least that I wanted to tell you about the disagreement in a village if people are from the same family. Thank you and be blessed.</p>
