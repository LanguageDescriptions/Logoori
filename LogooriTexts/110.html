<p> Liesunda himbe ku nyasaye</p>

<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Christianity</p>
<p>I am Benjamin Egadwa Okodi and I am in Jidereri.</p>
<p>Am talking about connection with God (continuation)</p>
<p>These are the laws that were given to a christian, in his life according to the the laws in the past from God. They are like this; all the villages have church members. The whole village has people who need to be assisted. This was said, that I should have not done things the way you do. You ate here last time, same to yesterday, and you have come back again. I am tired with you. You will get yours and you deny me. I am tired and my children are walking naked. The sick is told not to be sick. A log does not fall on the bird, instead it provides shelter and it pleases the bird.</p>
<p>You know God is hidding himself in them and he is the one who did the creation (1 Corinthians 1:27-28). Others are growing faster than then virgins. The word of God is talking about help John 15:6 is talking about Jacob and the true religion. Hunger is ever in our place. I am always having a loss. Others in (Mathew 25:31-46) what we are doing in our life is that we are preparing to give help to the one who deserves it. </p>
<p>We should keep the christian work in our budget because of the weak. We should keep the laws wherever they go even in hospital, to the sick, the blind. We should pray for our cattle of all types. All the religions in this world, we should organize for meetings for running the churches.</p>
<p>You should move close to God and he will move close to you Job 4:8 Paul the servant of God is the one who wrote the letter and sent to Jacob to give to the churches of the twelve tribes and pray for one another. Paul saw that they had reduced their faith. Because they were thinking about the wealth, wisdom and pride because they had those behaviours. </p>
<p>They appeared to them with anger. In Job 1:3 prevention Job 1:14-15, 4:1-2 and selfishness Job 2:15,16 and arrogance Job 4:2 praise at the entrance Job 4:16 these things are moving far from God Job 3:16 our tongue and words are the ones that keep people away from God. Job 3:6-8 faith without action is dead Job 2:20 that is the reason to why they were praying without receiving. Job 4:3 the good religion for God is the one that has actions. Jacob 1:27 we shall do this until we get to move close to God. </p>
<p>The action of moving close to God.</p>
<p>Christians are new in making his things Job 1:18 because we are like that we continue to read the holy book Job 1:25, Timothy 3:15,17 we continue to pray Job 5:16 we should not give up Job 2:9, we should be patient Job 1:4,12 we should repeant our sin Job 5:16 we should not be like of this world. Romans 12:2 so that we should be called the friends of God. Job 2:23 the friends of God are those who do his will. Mark 2:35, John 14:4 we should assist those who cannot assist themselves. Job 1:27 because others are born like that because of their work or sickness. Others is because of their world. Jesus had mercy on such people and he healed them.</p>
<p>We should have mercy on such , in doing that we should wait for our answers Job 1:26 we should be slow to anger Job 1:19,21 we should have wisdom that is coming from above Job 3:17,18 we should help those who have lost the truth. We should help these kind of people to be like the tree that has been planted near a river. Psalm 1:13 God is movig close to them.</p>
<p>Christian faith</p>
<p>Christians are believing in these things. Everyone who has the seed of christ in him because God has made someone in his own likeness, also because he blew in him his breath. All the people should shine before God like one thing. They should not do it in fear but in peace. They should not engage in war and pride. The one who went to engage in war and making weapons in most cases they do not reveal themselves. Mathew 5:37 all the things belong to God and we should take good care of them and use them the way he wants. We should have a heart of giving to those who lack and believe in the raising of the body and being alive that is coming years after year.</p>
<p>Jesus is the rock that does not shake, Hebrews 10:19-20 real christians have the courage to enter into the house of God because they are his children. The children are washed by the blodd of Jesus (20,21) the road that Jesus began is dying and raising of their soul, christians have to go through the death. Jesus christ is the one who will allow people into the kingdom of God. We should move close to him, with our true heart of mature faith. Before us we are washed by his precious blood. we should hold the armour of christ Corinthians 4:14 we should take the oath of christianity, we should wake each other in good deeds. We should encourage people to go to church, we should give presents and move the church and also give assistance to those who need assistance.</p>
<p>we should continue to go to church, we should prepare well as we show others good example and reac them. If we repeat the sins that we did, we should expect judgement and also shame that is painful. Most of the time people should move close to a person who is in christ. We should bless Abraham. Abraham said that the blessing is a sign of God showing those that will inherit the kingdom of God. Hebrews 6:9-12 Paul the servant is the one who wrote the letter to Philipines and God cannot forget the great thing that you are doing. Those who need to be assisted should seek for help and we should not be lazy, we should look for those who have inherited the kingdom and because of his rememberance he will not forget us. </p>
<p>We should give and be thankful for the gift of God to people, life, sunshine, rain, trees, farming, soil, years of life, stones and sand. All these things are the wealth of God. All these things do not reduce. There was hunger called Ubande in the year 1907, 1971 it was called Lilega, at the end of war in 1929 it was called Tsisige. In 1943 the hunger was called Kekombe in 1980 the rain of Kebedi and sickness. We are greatful to God because we have a good world. We harvest twice in a year; there is good rain, good sun and good soil. Our aim is to avoid poverty or more rich Psalms 39:9 we should fulfill that with the word Malachi 2:17. We should give to God every year part of what we receive from him, we should give to God and see wht he is doing for us. Malachi 3:10-12 our deeds should be seen by all.</p>
<p>1 Pihilipians Paul wrote the letter to philipians in the middle year between 1962-1964. Philipine was the first land to be ministered to by Paul. It is near water. It had minerals and hills were near this land. This name was used Philip of Macedonia lost his first ame and he was given this name and that is when the Philipians began to live in the land of Philipine. Paul went to Philipines for the second time on his way to Macedonia. The holy spirit led him there so that he could give assistance Acts 16:6, 4-10 a woman by the name Rudi was the first one to take christianity to america Acts 16:11-16 that was the Philipine church.</p>
<p>The church was in a difficult situation of war between Judea and Romans until Paul was arrested. Acts 16:19-24 some people in the church became weak because Paul was arrested. Philipians 1:7 it was to strengthen the spread of the bible Philipians 1:12-16 Paul brought light to the church. Philipians 1:27-30 Paul wanted them to be one thing Philipians 2:21 we as christians we should live according to the way the bible of christ is written. </p>
<p>We should fulfill the will of God Philipians 2:12-13 we shoul do all things without arrogance. Philipians 2:14 we should be the children of christ, in our words Philipians 2:15 we should spread this through ur actions. We should try to fulfill the will of God. We should have joy and rejoice Philipians 2:18 we should be servants of Jesus because they are looking at our lifestyle.</p>
<p>We should not put all our mind on the things that we own. If we do not have christ we will look like nothing. Philipians 3:8-9 we should struggle to look like christ. His death and raising from the dead philipians 3:10 we should walk in the laws of christ. Philipians 3:16 we should try to move ahead and be ready when God calls us philipians 3:12-14 we should watch and be servants of christ. Philipians 3:17 this action brings praise and teaches us to rejoice always. </p>
<p>Philipians 2:14-16 drowning takes away those who want to break our hearts. Philipians 2:19 is showing how we can be people of unity. We worship together like in Hebrews 10:24 we should pray for one another, we should teach one another. We should write to one another letters. We should give presents to one another. We should be in the book of life Philipians 4:7 the encouragement of Paul to the people in the book of life, by celebrating in christ. You should not worry even in a single thing. You should yearn for christ through prayer, be thankful in everything. All the nations, their lifestyle and even all the animals.</p>
<p>We should give food to the animals, we should not overburden them with activities, we treat them when they are sick. We give them a place to sleep and shelter even all the birds on the ground and the trees. We should show care to all these tings because God is the one who gives the richness and we go through these thngs. We should have a heart of giving. Philipians 4:15-16 we should keep christianity in doing philipians 4:9 thesalonians 3:13 because action brings wealth philipians 4:13 is the reason t why we keep God in everything because he kept us in a good world. </p>
<p>At first people who are unable to sustain themselves in Kenya are many; people who were able to sustain themselves used to say there are all kind of these people. It is not their wish, we read from the holy book about these type of people who are disable, blind, stammerers and many that Jesus christ had mercy on them and he healed them.</p>
<p>Causes of diseases</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some were born like that, others is because of work while others is because of their world. Od told them that wisdom is power. 1 corinthians 27:28 others because of wondering in their walk. Mathews 25:35-40 we have mercies on them . we should watch our tongue, we should give them food, cloth them and look for them a place where they can shelter. We should give them medicine when they are sick. We should pay them when they finish the work that they have been given. If they do any activity they should be praised. Those that can read they should be given the materials like books, margazines and other things. We should give them things that they can play with, if possible they can be carried to see the world and taught the word of God. They should be involved in the work of church.</p>
<p>The end result of Jesus disciples</p>
<p>The first one in the book of Mathew 10:4 they were troubled. They were courageous in faith, they perservired until the end. Mathew was killed by sword in the land of Ethiopia. Mark was pushed through the roads in Alexandria in Egypt and he died. Luke was hunged on a fruit tree in Greek. John was pushed inside hot oil, then he died a normal death as from the book of Ephesians. Jacob the son of Zebedee was chopped of his head. Jacob the son of Alphau was thrown out from the temple and he fell down and died. Philip was hunged from a tree. Bathelemew was killed while alive because of the rule from the head of the land where he was living.</p>
