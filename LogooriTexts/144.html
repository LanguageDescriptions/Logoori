<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">A girl who has been married in a witch home</p>
<p>My name is Carolyne Chesi today is on 6/5/2014. I am going to tell you about a girl who was married in a home where people were keeping animals for witching.</p>
<p>We had a girl who left home and went to Nairobi she stopped education. When she stopped school she asked her mother that she wanted to go and work. The mother asked her to go and ask the father to know that she was leaving. That girl the father was nto near; he had gone for grazing. When the father left the grazing place she took porridge and gave him where he was seating under a tree. The father took the porridge. When he had finished that girl went to take that gourd that he was using for porridge. When she took the gourd, she stood there for five minutes. The father asked her "you are standing here you want what? Go and wash the things that we were drinking porridge from." The girl told the father that she had a question for him. The father told her to ask the question. The girl told the father that she wanted to go and work. The father asked her "where are you going to work?" that girl told her that she was going to work from Nairobi the father asked her again "you are going to work for who?" that girl answered him,  "I am going to work for our neighbor." The father told her, "You are going to work, you wont continue with school." The girl told her that she was not seeing what she was reading because she was always the last student in the class. The father told her "it is true that in class you are not doing well, I had plaaned to take you to go and learn tailoring school." The girl told him "even if I go to learn tailoring and I do not know how to read, I will be doing nothing." The father asked her to go and agree with her mother. The girl went and told the mother that the father had agreed. The mother sent her to the person that she was supposed to go and work for her. The mother told her to go and bring that person they agree with her. That gilr went there because she was staying near she came with her and asked the mother to agree with her on the money that she was going to work for. Because the girl had not worked before she asked the mother to agree with her on the amount of money that she was going to work for. The mother spoke with the woman that the girl was going to work for. They agreed and she asked her to take her clothes they go. The girl took her clothes and she went with the woman that she was going to work for. When they went, they went to spend at the rural home of the woman and the following morning they took a vehicle to Nairobi. When they reached in Nairobi, the employer showed her how she was to work. During the weekend on Saturday, she asked her to go with her they go and see where she normaly buys groceries. She went with her employer who went to show her where she normaly buys things. When she showed her, again she asked her to follow her she go and show her where the market is and where she will be buying vegetables, tomatoes and onions. When they left there they returned home. When they got to where they were staying, they used all of those things and they got finished. When they got finished the employer told her that she had shown her where they normaly buy things. That girl answered her and told her that she knows that place. The employer took money and gave her to go and buy things and bring them. She bought those things and brought to where they normaly live. They used those things until they got finished. They used for one month because people in town buy things and they use them for one month because they have a place where they keep in a fridge. They used those things and they got finished. When she sent her more she went and bought and she passed a boy who was standing at a shop. When she was entering the place where they were staying that boy followed her and he greeted her. The girl greeted her and she asked him where he was staying. The girl told him that she will come he show her. The girl came and there was a day that the employer asked her to take the baby to the clinic. The girl took the baby to the clinic. When the boy saw her he greeted her and asked her if he could take her to where she was going. The girl aksed him to come they go together. They got to the clinic and they tested the baby and they came back. The boy didn't hesitate to aks her where she was staying. He asked her "where are you staying?" and she answered and told her "I am working for another woman down there." And he told her "I am staying behind this shop." He added, "I normaly wonder where you are coming from." That girl explained to him where she was staying. The boy explained to the girl where he stays. The girl went to where she stays and the boy went to where he stays. Again there was a day when the baby was sick and they asked the girl to take her to the hospital. The employee prepared herself she washed the baby and took her to the hospital. That boy saw the girl and they went together to the hospital. He asked her to give him the baby he assists her to carry. The girl gave her the baby he carried her and they went and arrived at the hospital. They checked the baby and gave her medicine and they returned where they were coming from. While on the road the boy continued to ask the girl questions. The girl answered him. The boy asked her "you are from which tribe?" the girl told him her tribe. The girl also asked the boy that he was from which tribe and the boyt old her. When they told each other about their tribe they went away separately. There was a day the girl went to the shop, the boy saw her and told her "you prepare a day and come to see where I stay." The gilr told him "I get a break on Saturday I will tell you." On sundaythe girl went to know where the boy stays and the boy had invited her and told her where they will meet. Hen they met they went where the boy stays. The girl stayed there and she went back to her work in the evening. When the boy was escorting her back he asked him from which part of maragoli was she coming from? The girl told him that she comes from Mbale and the boy told her that he was coming from Isukha. They became friends and they were visiting each other on Sunday. There was a Sunday the girl went there and the boy told her "I can see you have become an adult, do not work for people, we can get married?" the gilr told him that she was going to ask her employer. The boy told the girl that if she goes to ask the employer that she wants to get married she doesn't know how her employer is; she may take me to jail or stop you from marrying me. The boy asked the girl to go and pack her clothes and come. The girl went and packed her clothes and then she came to where the boy was staying. The employer waited for her but she didn't see her. She met with her employer and the employer inquired from her where she had gone and she she replied that the employer had her husband, and she had found her's. They began life. They stayed for three years without getting a baby. They sat and shared ideas on how they could get baby and why were they not getting a baby. The boy told the girl that he doesn't know and he asked her if she was the one causing the problem. The girl told him that since she was born she has never received a baby, and they cannot know who has the problem. The boy told her that they organize for a day they go to up country and visit their parents maybe when the parents heard that they were married they spoke something hence they go and the parents spit on them. They organized for a day and they went home. And because this boy had informed the parents that he had married when the parents saw them they were very happy. They welcomed them in the house, they prepared water for them to bath and then they gave them tea and they took it. They spent one night there and the following morning the boy went to his parents and explained to them about the issue personaly. When he explained to his parents, the boy knew the things that they do at their home but he had not told his wife, the parents asked the boy if he had told the girl about the ritual that is done at their home. The boy told them that he had not told her; he felt that if he told her she would run away. The parents told the boy and they discussed how they could do it, there was a day the boy took a cutting tool and he began to run on the field with his father. The girl didn't know the plan that they had planned. The mther in law asked the girl to take a bucket and fetch water they will have visitors. The girl began fetching water and the mother in law called her daughters to cook food they prepared meals for the visitors. They prepared chapati, chicken, meat, rice and Irish potatoes. When they had finished cooking the father in law went and sat at "chamugitsi" and the mother in law at "kivitu" and the girls and that wife sat at "muhiru." And the elder daughter of this mother in law took leso and kept down from "chamugitsi to chandangu." When she did that they took food and went to put in "muhiru." When they arranged the food there they asked the wife to come with water for washing hands. The wife asked them why they were spreading the leso down and they told her not to ask instead she will see it, our visitors are going to walk on them. The wife was wondering who the isitors were. They brought those meals and they arranged them and the wife came with water and they asked her to hold it for the visitors to wash their hands. The wife argued and wanted to know where the visiotrs were and they told her follow what they tell her to do and she should not be afraid. That wife stood with the water, while she was standing; she saw two snakes coming from the back door of the house with necklaces on their necks. That gilr was terrified and they yelled at er and told her that if she poour water on their visitors she will be in trouble. She tried and holds the water and the visitors came and sipped the water, they sipped the food. One of the snakes sipped water and the food and then it went out through the front door, the other snake did the same. They told that girl that was their visitor that they were telling her. They told her that since the snakes have spitted at them from that day they were going to get children. They asked that girl to sit down they eat the food because that girl was afraid she didn't sit down. She asked them to allow her to continue fetching water; she will take the food later. Something binded their eyes they didn't know that this girl will run away. They continued eating those meals and the girl continued fetching water. When they finished eating that girl took the utensils and she began cleaning them. When she finished she prepared for her husband water and he went to bath. It was at night and that boy was an alcoholic. When he went to take alcohol he left the wife sleeping. When she knew that the husband had gone to take alcohol she stole her clothes and hid them on the fence. When the boy came back, the wife took the food and gave him to eat; they had not known that she wanted to run away. They went to sleep and because and alcoholic person sleeps fast, that boy slept and the wife ensured that he was aleep. She jumped over him and she didn't bother to know if it was dark at night. She went and took her clothes where she had kept on the fence and she left. She walked slowly as she listened. When the boy woke up he found that the wife was not on the bed, he was patient and he thought maybe the wife had out for a short call. He waited for her but she didn't come back. The boy went to his parent's door and knocked then he asked if the wife was inside there the parents told him that she was not there. He told them that he woke up and found out that she was not there he thought that she had gone to the toilet but she didn't come back, he thought that she had come to sleep there because of what she had seen and the fear that she had. The parents asked him to go and look for her maybe she is in the toilet. The boy looked at the toilet, bathroom, he looked everywhere but he didn't see her. The boy went and woke up his friends and told them that his wife had gone outside but he was not seeing her, and he didn't know where she had gone to, he had gone to her mothers place and she was not there, he had checked in the toilet and the bathroom and he was not seeing her. The friends asked him to go and look if the clothes were there. The boy went and looked for the clothes of his wife but he didn't see them. He was astonished and he said that she had ran away and he wondered where she had gone that because she didn't know neighbors they just came recently and she had not spoken to a neighbor yet. They took touches and started following that girl but they didn't find her. And when she saw the touches she hid in the bushes and then they come and pass. When they went far away for a short distance and then she follows them. When they lit the torches back she used to hide. When they got on the road the girl saw them going back home, she went and hid behind the shop and waited for them to go away then she began going home. She walked o foot from Ileo up to Mbale because she had seen a problem and she didn't care if something will terrify her on the road or the journey was long, because if you have seen trouble you do not have fear. That girl arrived home in the morning. She went and woke her parents, they opened the door and they were shocked. And because she had gone to the bush the clothes were torn. The parents cried and asked her, "What is the problem?" She asked them to wait for her to rest she will tell them what she had seen. They gave her water to go and bath first. She bathed, they gave her food but she didn't eat. That girl they gave her a place where to sleep. In the morning they gave tea and then they begged her to tell them what made her to come back home that night with the clothes torned. That gilr began to explain and she told her mother that when she left she said that she was going to work. When she got there she met a boy who asked her to marry him. They finished three years without getting a baby. He asked her to go to his up country for his parents to spit on them for them to have a baby. When they got there they told her that they had visitors, She saw snakes coming and she was very terrified. They made food. The parents told her that they asked her to go and learn tailoring. The girl asked for forgiveness from them she told them that she didn't know what she was doing. The girl told them that from that day she wont get married because of what she had seen. Today that girl is working; she has bought her land and builds her home she is staying there.</p>

<p>When I came here it was the year 1992 and I found the houses were scarcly populated. There was no neighbor near and the grass had overgrow. Even when someone used to come you could not see him. You used to be surprised thathe has already reached where you were. A shop and posho mill was at Avosa. Someone used to grind her flour that she knew would last for a week and aslo the things to us in the kitchen like the salt she used to buy the ones that she knew will last for those day. The hospital was not near. Whenever someone was sick he was taken to Kaimosi or Mbale where these people came from. The school was in Ichitu or Imusunji. People who had migrated to this place they used to say "even where we came from was good, they brought us here to do what." But because the government brought them they were patient. They perservired until the light was brought here. They removed the bushes that were here and they began to build their houses, they continued to build until they all migrated to this place. When they had migrated here it looked like a place where people are staying. The people sat down and they discussed and they found one person who started a posho mill and another one started a shop. We knew that they had reduced for us the walking distance and we also knew that we had come out of darkness. Our men sat together and they plaaned how they could get a school. They agreed to go and visit our MP who was Khaniri. They went and presented their plea and then he told them that they go back he has heard their plea. He said that he would begin by building a hospital in Shiru. When he builds and finished he came to check if a school could fit in Jidereri. He organized for a day and he came to plan how they can start a school and they began with a nursery. He used to come and leave what he had and they continue to build the school. They continued building that school up to where it is and our MP Khaniri assisted them. He came back and gave them what he had; they continued to build it until they built the toilets. Our elder men appreciated him, we also appreciated him for the good work that he did for us. </p>

<p>PEOPLE WHO JUMP OUT AT NIGHT</p>
<p>A person who jumps out at night is the one who has a cheetar. When that person goes outside to jump at nigh he goes to jump there at night. When he goes out he asks the wife to step on a cooking stone until he comes back. When the husband goes out to run the wife steps on that stone until the husband comes back in the house. And that person who is jumping outside at night he takes soil and throws it on top of people's iron sheets, or if you have a rope for drying clothes he stretches it. If you are coward you can run away from the house. When the wife removes the foot from the stone the husband will be caught, when he comes back he beats the wife very bad, and tells her "I asked you to step on this stone until I come back, why did you remove your foot?" and fro him when he is caught outside there he is beaten thoroughly. And if that person has boys because the boys listen to the father he takes some of those things and gives them. And if his daughter has been married somewhere and she is not giving birth and she had not taken those things, she goes back home they give her those things. And when they give her they keep them in a pot for her to carry them from it. and when she goes with them to the home where she was married they should also have those things, she cannot go with them there if they have not kept those things. When she takes those tings and goes with them there she will start to receive children. When she gets a child people know that they are witch and they are also people who jump out at night.</p>
