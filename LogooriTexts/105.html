<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">The lifestyle of a poor person</p>
<p>Linet Mmbone from Jideleli.</p>
<p> The lifestyle of a poor person.</p>
<p>I want to tell you the way a poor person stays and the way an elder person stays. I will start by telling the way a poor person stays.</p>
<p>My father and mother told me that when they gave birth to me they very poor. They were so poor. People criticized them because they were very poor. When they gave birth to me they did not have anything. My mother told me that she survived on black tea without sugar, until in the evening when my father could return home with a little maize. When my father came home in the evening there was no money to take the maize to the posho mill and they had to fry the maize on fire then they take it and sleep.</p>
<p>My mother was praying everyday, day and night. In the morning my mother seemed not to have energy at all. My mother and father perservired in their stay. Even when my siblings began to cry my mother used to pray everytime. When she was sitting she could see a good samaritan who could bring her flour in a cup.</p>
<p>My mother could really appreciate then she put it on fire and start to cook porridge. She could then take the porridge and serve her children. And she could really appreciate and she continued to pray always. She did not have money to buy even soap. She used plain water to wash clothes and clean herself, she could then pray to God who made her. My mother believed in everything. Whatever she got she appreciated and prayed God as I grew and he gave us good health. There came a time my parents wanted to take me to school but they didn't have the ability to take me to school. </p>
<p>My father left home very early in the morning and went to see his friend. He talked to his friend the way he wanted then he returned home. He started to ask himself many questions. With the reason that I didn't have cloth, the second thing is that they didn't have a way of getting it. My mother began to think deeply. But God gave her wisdom and he used her. She took the torned cloth that I was putting on then she washed in the evening. In the morning she heard someone knocking the door and calling her. "Adebe, where is the child?" my father did very fast and we went to school in company of his friend. He met the teacher and explained to her what he wanted. The friend to Adebe knew my problem.</p>
<p>When they approched the teacher she said "You have brought me a student" he replied by saying that he has brought a student but he does not have money. She asked my father to if he could manage to work for the school as a watchman. My father accepted, he didn't refuse. Then I started schooling. When I finished schooling I passed my exams highly. I stayed at home for six months. One day I saw my uncle coming. When he arrived at our home, at first he asked questions.</p>
<p>He asked my parents if I could go with him to Kakamega. My parents thought for a while then they allowed my uncle to go with me. The time came and we started the journey. When we arrived at Kakamega we alighted then we stopped for a while then someone called my uncle, he was his friend. I sat somewhere and I saw a piece of cloth, then I took a stick and pulled the piece of cloth near but I didn't look inside at that time.</p>
<p>I was happy in my heart because I saw that the lord had given me something, because I had not seen money, I was worried. When my uncle came we started the journey to his home. I didn't tell him anything. At night I went to rest. I opened the peace of cloth and began to cont the money. I felt my heart resting. I thanked God, very much. In the morning I told my uncle that I am used to our problems and I want to go back home. I started my journey and moved home very fast and I arrived there.</p>
<p>When I arrived at home I prayed, then I asked where my mother and my father were. I was happy and I told my father that something that one has picked is not stolen. My parents sat down then I told them what happened. I thought of things to make God know that I am helping them. The first thing was to build a house. They started asking questions. They were worried in their heart, God started changing our lives, we started the business of selling maize and other things. God knew the reason to why he made his two people and kept them on this world. The first thing is that a good person is someone who knows God. This person likes truth. A good person has a merciful heart everytime and he is not jelousy. Today I know what poverty means. It means if you have something, share it with the other person because you have it today and tommorow the other person will also have it too. And you the rich person you be careful and clever, you pray God to give you wisdom. I have ended there.</p>
<p>I also want to tell you the other side of the rich person.</p>
<p>This rich person while he is living in the world he doesn't want any weak person in his homestead. He doesn't want anyone to step on his compound. With the reason that he doesn't imagine lacking anything. If the poor person is working for him, when they prepare tea, he will be given tea without sugar. They will add more water to the tea. They take meat, but a poor person is given kales with salt alone. This person does not expect you to rush and ask for money after you have worked for him. This person leaves you at his home, and once he has left you he forgets the problems that brought you to his house. He returns home very late in the evening. You remain seated there until you get tired, and you do not see him. The reason is that this rich person doesn't have any problem. You should know that it is God who made you and also made this poor person. You should know that it is God who gave you these things and on that note, you should ask yourself , why did God make his people. This story is teaching us that we stay on this world with wisdom. We pray to God who made and kept us on this world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I want to tell you a story about eleven girls who went to look for firewood.</p>
<p>These girls went to the forest to look for firewood and found a pit. They asked one of them to get into the pit. When this girl got inside the pit, she got lost, the other girls were afraid because they used to go to look for firewood together. They asked themselves questions. They tried to look inside the pit but they didn't see the other girl. Those girls began to sing:</p>
<p>Girls went to look for firewood, they found a hole *2</p>
<p>They asked one of them to get inside very fast and she got inside</p>
<p>Woyi *2</p>
<p>Today I will do what</p>
<p>Woyi *2</p>
<p>Today I will do what</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I had cut a leg inside where I was,</p>
<p>I cut, I cut the toe</p>
<p>I hanged inside where I was</p>
<p>I turned*2</p>
<p></p>
<p>The girls kept their firewood toghether, before they began the journey back home they sat down and started asking themselves questions. They knew that if they return home, their mother will kill them because one of their child was missing. When these girls were going home they heard something amaking noise inside a bush. The girl who was leading saw an ogre crossing the road very fast. The ogre had rushed to block their way. The ogre asked them to tell him where the other girl was, and the girl who was infront began to sing: </p>
<p></p>
<p>Kadesa woo*2 (*Kadesa is the name of the ogre)</p>
<p>Hunger in the stomach</p>
<p>Kadesa woo*2</p>
<p>Hunger in the stomach</p>
<p></p>
<p>Magu ulutsi, </p>
<p>Magu ulugeli,</p>
<p>Move out of the way we pass</p>
<p></p>
<p>Those girls continued to sing like that until they all finished singing it. The ogre caught the last girl and took her to the pit where the other girl was. When these girls saw that they ran home very fast and when they arrived near home they began screaming. Their mother knew all their voice. When she had their voice she went out of the house very fast to know what had happened to her girls. The remaining girls told their mother what happened when they went to look for firewood. When the mother heard that she began screaming and she ran to the forest, and when she arrived there she found that the rain had rained and the river was flooded, the mother tried her best but she didn't manage. Because she didn't have anything to do. She returned home, one day a cowboy went to graze. When this woman saw the cowboy she told her that her girls had lost in the forest. The cowboy went to graze the cows then one of the cows got lost in the forest and he started to look for it. While he was looking for it, the cow ran very fast. He met two girls and asked them where they were staying and they ttold her that the ogre had taken them to it's house. The cowboy asked them what they could do to kill the ogres. One of the girls suggested that they take mud and apply on their body then they take some leaves and tie them around their body, and he provide some sharp object. The cowboy used that method then they ran very fast. They reached the river and they crossed together with the cowboy, while they were approching home a woman saw  some people in mud and they had leaves. They were also dancing. The woman who was their mother kept the pot that she was carrying down because she knew her children and the way they were walking and talking. She ran very fast to hug them. She got near the girls and she began to sing:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nzelelelelele mother, Nzelelelelele</p>
<p>Our girls</p>
<p>Nzelelelelele</p>
<p>Our girls</p>
<p>Nzelelelelele</p>
<p>Ogre wooi*4</p>
<p>The girls that had remained home, one of them heard the voice of their mother and she called the others. They went to welcome the two, and returned home in jubilation. They prepared a party. The following morning, the girl who was tricked to enter the hole asked her sisters questions. She asked them why they tricked her to eneter the pit. She told them that she will leave alone, and she won't have them as her sisters forever in her life.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
