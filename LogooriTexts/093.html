<p>Stories</p>
<p></p>
<p>There were two girls who had gone to look for firewood and they found a pit and they said:</p>
<p>Woiyi *2</p>
<p>Now what will I do today  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Woiyi *2</p>
<p>Now what will I do today </p>
<p></p>
<p>There was a girl who was there and another boy went to ask her to marry her. When they took her to that home they lit fire and kept water inside the drum. A neighbor asked her why she had come to that homestead. She said that the boy had brought her. She told her that the water that was being boiled was meant to cook her and then they eat her. When they went to the river to fetch water it spilled down.</p>
<p>They stayed there for three hours and they said "a aa we are fetching water as it spill down" when they came back they found that the girl had chased 100 cows to her home. The cows were tied with flowers and she went as she sang. They asked where the cows had gone and people told them that the girl that he had brought had chased the cows and gone with them. Now where will we find her and shake catch her hand. They saw her from a far distance going away with the cows as she sang.</p>
<p>They asked her to stop there and allow the water to fall down since it had stopped. She asked them to wait then she told them that she let the water to fall. She spoke to the water "my water fall down and go to the sister and the other one to the mother" when they reached at the middle she asked the water to meet again and the people who were following her drowned and died. And the girl went home in jubilation and when the parents heard the voice they said it sounds like their girl they came and opened the door for her and they let here in.  </p>
<p>That is your girl, </p>
<p>She is the one</p>
<p>That is your girl, </p>
<p>She is the one*3</p>
<p>With cows    </p>
<p></p>
<p>That is your girl, </p>
<p>She is the one</p>
<p>That is your girl, </p>
<p>She is the one*3</p>
<p>With cows</p>
<p>They celebrated and the ones that were following the girl died.</p>
<p>My story ends there.</p>
