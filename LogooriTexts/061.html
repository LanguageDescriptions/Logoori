<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Old men teachings to men</p>
<p>I am Henry Nyareso Munangwe. And I am going to tell you teachings that the old men passed to men who wanted to marry wives.</p>
<p>Our grandfathers used to say the one who defeated a woman defeated an elephant. This is a proverb that our grandfather used especially when the life of a man and his wife is at the trial moment. They taught men in different stages. Even from Adam it was like that because Adam followed the words of the wife and he was cursed by God. </p>
<p>A woman was made from a man's rib but the wisdom of a woman is more and wide. So God is looking if you as a man can defeat her. Long time ago people feared elephant because it was difficult to kill it. Boys were told that a woman is like an elephant, because when a woman speaks a lie, most of the people normaly believe it. You could not argue with a woman and defeat her. If a woman sends you foes they can easily kill you. If she wants to kill you through the food it is easy because she is the one who is cooking. </p>
<p>If a woman wants to have friendship with you it is easy because, her attraction pulls you near. She can cook medicine for you until you become a fool. If a woman wants to know or see your secret it is very easy. A woman makes you to disagree with your parents, relatives or friends. A woman can make you be poor or have an income. A woman destroys or build the homestead. A woman can engage in adultery and give birth to children who are not yours. These are the things that make old men to teach young men who are getting married.</p>
<p>In the bible Samson was shaved by his wife Delilah. They are also taught that Naomi made Ruth to get a child from Boaz. Even David who was wise, he got himself in problems when he was attracted to Uriah's wife. Another old proverb was like this; do not play on the stone, the stone is warm. A woman has warmth and she can cause you to slide; and if you fall down you will break your back. Once a woman has given birth to children she becomes a stone and she defeats the husband. Most of the men have been chased away by the women, others have lost in urban towns with other women and others kill themselves. They have more strength than the men who married them.</p>
<p>This proverb is real, your behavior and weakness makes the woman be like an elephant. And also when you wanted to marry you didn't just walk there in one day like these days. You were inquiring they are which type of people, maybe they are witch or people who are not good. You also inquired their tribe, if possible you could invite one another before getting married. Or you do a wedding when people are seeing and celebrating you. Boys were encouraged to stand strong, you were to build your house first before you bring a wife. You could buy enough clothes, a hen or a cow. You could buy items for sleeping on before you marry. These were items that were required at first before you bring the wife that you wanted to marry.</p>
<p>What follows is this: you should be able to bring food in the house, you should be able to meet her sexual expectations so that she feels that she is having a man. You reduce sleep and make your woman happy. You should not stay away from her for over six months. You should introduce your wife to your relatives. Your wife should not walk along with women who lack good morals. Your wife should be able to cook food that is good to you and your children. You wife should be hardworking and also teach your children good morals. As a man you should not spend more time in the kitchen and also cooking.</p>
<p>There is a proverb that says where "endovo" has moved from or died another one normaly grows there. This proverb was used by old men because when a husband lost her wife, you were allowed to marry another woman who met the requirements. We also have another proverb: death snatches you. If you were not taking good care of your wife, she could get married to another man or die. That is what this proverb meant. If a woman gave birth to a child, you were not allowed to yell or beat her always. You were not allowed to walk in the forest early in the morning. You were not allowed to make noise in the house or fight always. The child could get a shock while in the womb of her mother. These were the facts that a man who was getting married was to know: if you are a man and your wife is pregnant sometimes she become lazy, she refuse to eat and she becomes allergic to some food as she spits while she is cooking.</p>
<p>She can even refuse to sleep together with the husband. She refuse someone to make arguments with her. She has harsh tongue and reply. Sometimes she may want the husband close. Sometimes giving birth is a problem and she amy have to undergo surgery. A man had to know that a woman is a great thing. We have "Kidwadi" means a girl who gave birth to a child before getting married. Girls were taken care of up to the age of 22 then they get married. She was taught good morals and the way she could take care of her family and she was to follow the teachings that she was given by elders. In order to take care of her house and also stay well in her house.</p>
<p>If another man who is not her husband asks her for friendship, she was to resist with her whole heart. As a girl you were to stick to the husband who has married you alone. The term "Kidwadi" refers to a girl who gave birth to a child while she was still with her parents. This girl was not trustworthy. Even if she wedded, the wedding was done in the evening then she could be taken to her house through the bushes. The old people had separate ways of doing this, a person who gave birth to a child before marriage was not allowed to carry a flower. If you cheated you could die, you were not allowed to stand at the wedding. If the girl was pregnant she was not allowed to undergo the normal wedding procedure, because the child could easily die. A girl who was a virgin was highly respected, because she had respect too. They could even take a cow to her home and prepare food. That is the reason to why most girls took care of themselves so that they be treated with such respect.</p>
<p>There is a word that we say uncircumcised person (mundu musoleli). This is a person who has not been circumcised. These are the people who are taught a lot of things, so that when they will get married they know how to take good care of their wives. There is another proverbs that says do not look at your mothers old age and say that father threw his cows. This proverb means you should not look at your mother while she is old then you look down upon her. You should know that when your father married her she was beautiful and she was a girl who belonged to her parents. You should also know that when your mother got married to your father she saw, that he was handsome and strong. These are some of the teachings that the old men taught. There are more but because of time I have given that.</p>
