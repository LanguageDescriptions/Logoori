<p>Kwali ho nu mwami nu mukali wewe. Vavili yava vamenya vulahi mu kivala chavo kandi vamiha vandu vavo mu inzila iveye indahi ligali. Vandu vi kivala chene yicho vayanzitswa ni liamiha liu mwami uyu ligali muno. Mu ligesa liu muhiga gwa kavili, mwami halala nu mukali weve vanyola mwana mukana. Vwali  vuyanzi vunene ligali ku mwami halala ni mukali weve. Kandi halala na vandu ve kivala chene yicho chu mwami yamihamu. Mukana uyu yali mukana wi ligondo lilahi ligali mkuino. Yali mulavi tswe kuli lilumbi liu kugilu. Yali ni lisu litambi lilahi limwamu laiduka ku mugongo. Mukana uyu yali ni ligondo lilahi liayanzitsa vandu vosi halal na viko. Muhiga gwalonda ku kindu kidamanu chikoleka mu vwam,ishi vwu mwami uyu. Mukali  wu mwami na aveye nyina mwana uyu yamanya nakutsa. Lwa yakutsa vandu vala vavelela ligali ku likuitsa liu mukali wu mwami. Navutsa mwami yamanya nashila anoho naleta mukali undi. Mukali uyu niye yamanya yatse kulinda mwana mukana uyu wa valanga Nyamusi; nava kuli mama wa kambo. Mukali uyu yali mukali wu mwoyo mudamanu sana. Yavititsila mwana uyu mu limenya liveye lidinyu, agela mwana uyu tsigasi tsiveye tsindinyu, amukolitsa miyinzi midinyu ligali. Mwami si yayanzitswa ni liva liene yili dave navutsa yikutsila nu mukali weve. Vamenya ndio mihiga minyinge; mukali uyu yatsitsagilila kuva nu mwoyo gwe imbodoka ku kana yaka na mukana uyu yali ni ligondo lilahi ligali. Kindu chu kugenyia mukali wu mwami uyu yali ni cherolo cha verolamu vakisava vulahi utsia wehenza kuli wivichi ku utula niva utsitsa mu lugendo. Cherolo chene kila chali yakivika kwi lidichi mu ilumu yayagona. Niyenya kutula niyenya kutsia ku lugendo yatsitsa mu cherolo yiki yehenzera mu natula kwisinga, lwa yifwaye niva yivichi tsinguve tsindahi niva havundu havedechi ma arukingitsa. Cherolo chene yichi chali nu vugeli vwo komoloma kuli linyonyi lia valanga kasuku. Mukali wu mwami uyu ndi yatsitsa mu cherolo yiki niyakenya kutula ni yakenya kutsia mu lugendo akemolomela. Yatsitsamu akivolela, "cherolo change kilahi kwidiji; vakali vosi vaveye mu vwamishi vwu mwami uyu, mukali ki aveye wi ligondo lilahi kandi ayanzitsaa vandu vosi." Cherolo yiki chamujiba klimuvolela, "ooh, mukali  wu mwami; vakali vosi vi liamiha liu mwami uyu, avula ho mukali undi aveye ni ligondo lilahi kuvita yive; yive niye uveye ni igondo lilahi kuvita vosi." Mukali wu mwami lwa yahulila ndio, yayanzitswaa ligali na mang'ana gene yago kijira kolondekana nu mwoyo gwegwe gwe embodoka si yenya ku ahilili mukali undi wosi mu losoma lwene lula ndi aveye ni ligondo lilahi kuvita oyo dave. Yamenya ndio mihiga minyinge natsitsa ni yenya kutula atsia ateva cherolo cheche "ngoteva cherolo change, mukali ki aveye ni ligondo lilahi kuvita vosi?" Cherolo chamujiba vutsa kuli yenya. Yahulila ndio yayanza ligali vuyanzi vunene ligali. Liali ho lidiku lilala, mukali wu mwami yateva liteva lia kase ku cherolo chiche "cherolo change kwidiji, mu vakali vosi vo losoma yilu, ni mukali ki anoho ni mukali uliha uveye ni ligondo lilahi kuvita vosi. Cherolo chahugila kimuvolela, mugogo mulahi wu mwami, vakali vosi vo losoma yilu yive weng'ine niye uveye ni ligondo lilahi navutswa lelo lidiku lia kalunu, giligali nyenya ngovole kandi nzisuhanga; mukana Nyamusi niye uveye ni ligondo lilahi kuvita vosi." Lwu mukali uyu yahulila ndio siyayanzitswa na mang'ana yago dave. Yahenza mukana Nyamusi mugalaha nalola ai, kweli nigiligale yali ni ligondo lilahi ligali muno. Mwoyo gwe embodoka gwamedeka mu mukali uyu vudiku na mmbasu. Yamanya nalanga mulala ku vasigari veve namuvolela avuguli Nyamusi amushile mu mulitu hagati ma amusinziri wene yila ma amuleke wene yila kijira si yenya kumulola ku kali hadidi dave. Musigari yavugula Nyamusi namushila mu mulitu. Lwa yatulitsa mmbano gwigwe ni yenya kumusinza, Nyamusi yalila namugoyanyia namuvolela atamwita dave aleke yiluki atsie mu mulitu na sialilana kandi yego dave. Musigari oyo yalola Nyamusi nalila, yanyola mwoyo gwu vuveleli na muverela ligali. Yilanyia muvano gwegwe navolela Nyamusi yiluki tsimbiru ligali muno tsinyama tsiu mu mulitu tsivuli kumulia. Nyamusi yamanya nanyagula tsimbiru ligali. Yanyagula nanyagula logendo lonene ku lwa madiku gavaga natalola kali inyumba yosi anoho kwagana ku kali nu mundu wosi anoho kali kwagana ni inyama yosi yu mu vulimu. Yasira mu kivanda ni vivanda, yavita mu visaka magina gamukaraga mu virenge kandi mafwa nigamutandula tsinguvu navutsa si yaluha dave. Yatsitsagilila kunyagula ni kivune si yenya kwilana yengo wavo kolondekana ku mwoyo mudamanu gwa mama weve wa kambo; yali kali anyala kummiga anoho amwite. Ku yatsitsagilila kunyagula ku nangwa anyole havundu ha anyala kwibama ave wene yila navutsa ave mwoyo. Yagana ku ni inyama yosi yu mu vulimu inyala kumugosa dave. Lidiku lia kola ganne, Nyamusi yali niyakaluha, virenge viali ni viakavimba, kali tsinguvu tsitanduchi, mafwa gamutsomi mu virenge, kindu kilahi yamanya nalola kayumba kalahi ligali munokaveye ku kigulu. Yali yakaluha navutsa yidinyia naduka ha kayumba kene kala kali ni kaveye ku kigulu. Yakong'onda ku muliango navutsa mundu wosi wosi si yajiba ku dave. Yamanya nalumba muliango nu gwiguka ni yingila munyumba yimu. Lwa yahenza mu kayumba yako, yalola mu mang'ana gu kugenyia ligali. Muhilu mwali mubangiywi vulahi, nahenza komesa yalola ku tsisahani saba tsiu viukulia, mivano jiali ku kandi saba ni vijiko navutsa gu kugenyia vindu viene vila viala tsa vimbe vimbe si viala vitambi kuli vandu va kawaida dave. Vuma vwali ku, vosera vwavaku mu visanda; viukulia viali vibangiywi ku mesa kula. Lwa yisunda havulili, yalola vidali saba. Visoi vailiywi mu inzila iveye indahi ligali muno. Nyamusi yali nalushi ligali muno kijira kunyagula mu mulitu ku lwa madiku ganne. Yahulila inzala munda mwimwe indulu ligali kandi yalki nu vuluhu vunyinge. Navutsa yali nu vuti vwu kulia ku viukulia yivi viali ni vibangiywi munyumba yimu. Yamanya navugula chukulia vuli ku isahani kidi kidi ku nangwa vene viukulia vila lwa vatsa vavuli kumanya mundu yakulia ku viukulia yivi dave. Vosela vwali mu visanda kandi anwa ku vudi vudi. Amatsi gali ho mu tsigilasi kijira yali nu vuluhu. Lwa yali ni yakiguta, yamanya natsia ivuli kososa ma nagona. Yagona tsindolo ligali tsinene kijira yali nalushi. Ngani inyumba yila yali ya manani saba. Lwa yaduka hamugorova, manani gala gilana mmba mwavo kijira mmbasu gwosi gahonganga mu kigulu ni gakavanga cha galia; gagenda kali gatsia mu mulitu igasagal chukulia ni gahitsa itsinyama tsiu mu vulimu. Lwa manani gala gaduka hamuliango, linani lilala liavola, "inze mbulila inyama yu mundu viifunya." Kandi linde livola, kali yinze mbulila tsa ndio mpaga gosi saba gavola gahula inyama yu mundu ni ifunya mu inyumba mula. Lwa vigula muliango ni gingila mmba, nigahambitsa kisala chu mulilu gamulikili kijira vwali vudiku isa ya kamwama. Linani liu kutanga liamulika ku mesa; liakuba tsikwili ni nivola, "vwaha aliye chukulia change." Gandi sita gala kandi gahenza ku chukulia chavo ganyola kandi mundu aliye chukulia chavo. Gahenza kandi ku visanda vio ovosera ganyola kandi mundu yakunwa ku. Gosi ndio kakuba liyoga gavola mundu paga ave aveye munyumba yimu. Gamulika ni gahenza kali hasi we tsimesa, mulwalo mwe kidali; galola mundu dave. Gamanya ni gasagala ligali  navutsa linani lilala liali ku likutsutsu liamanya  wa liaduka ha kidali ha lia, ni livola "hambi mulole mundu agoni ku kidali change." Gandi ganyagula tsimbilu nigatsia ni ganyola mukana mulahi ni ligondo lilahi liu kuyanzitsa na agoni kiu vugono vwali vwi linani liali ku likutsutsu. Linani lilala liamanya livola , "kumulie" na gandi nigagaya, "awa, mukana mulahi ni ligondo lilahi ndi si kumulia dave." Gamanya niganyenyeka galaha kijira sigenya kumuvukitsa dave. Gatsia ni gikala komesa nigalia viukulia viavo, nigwnua ovosera vwavo mu galaha ma nigatsia ni gagona. Linani liene Nyamusi yali nagoni ku kidali cheche, liamanya linyenyeka galaha ligona havirenge. Nyamusi lwa yavuka asubui, yegosa kolola amanani saba yago. Manani gamuvolela ategosa dave nigamuteva lyita lilye navola vamulanga Nyamusi. Gamuteva "na uduchi ndi mu kivala chitu kinu kijira kivala kinu vandu kuli yivi sivamenyi ku yinu dave." Nyamusi yamanya ni yivalila manani gala kuli nyina weve wa kambo yamuvititsila mu limenya lidinyu ku nangwa kali naduka havundu navolela musigari amusinzi na musigari ula yamanya namuvelela ku niyiluka ni cho chajira naduka munyumba yavo. Manani gamuvelela ligali muno. Linani lialiku likulundu liamuvolela oveye mukana wu mwoyo mulahi kandi uveye ni ligondo lolahi ligali muno. Kunyi kulitsa vandu nitale si kulakulia dave, kwenya umenya na kunyi, okodekelange chukulia na kunyi ni kutsi kuhitsa tsinyama mu mulitu, ukunihitsila inyumba yitu yinu, okwogitsila vindu kandi ukufuyila tsinguvu no kokolombela vunifu hango hano. Nyamusi yali nu vuyanzi ligali kuhula manani ni gavola ndio kandi yamanya mama weve wa kambo si anyala kumunyola ku nangwa amwite dave. Manani lwa gasimuka asubui nigatsia mu lihitsa gavolela Nyamusi atigulila ku mundu wosi wosi muliango dave. Nyamusi yayanzitswa kumenya na manani yaga mu mulitu. Manani gatsanga hamugorova ganyola kindu chosi nikilombeywe vulahi ligali muno. Na ko lovega lundi lula, mama weve wa kambo uyu yalolatsa Nyamusi wa yatsia yaitwa yakutsa. Kandi lihelemelitswa aveye kuho mukali undi aveye ni ligondo lilahi kuvita oyo dave. Yamanya niyitsulitsa "leka kalunu nzie kuteva ku cherolo change mateva gange kavetsa ga vuli kase." Yamanya natsia mu cherolo cheche kimanya kimoloma kila naketeva; "oh, cherolo change kilahi, mu vakali vosi vo losoma yilu, ni mukali ki uveye ni ligondo lilahi kuvita vosi?" Cherolo chahugilila ni kevola, "oh yive mukali mulahi wu mwami, agiligali ndakovolela. Nyamusi yakutsa dave aveye mu mulitu yamenya na manani. Kali niva yive uveye ni ligondo lilahi, udukila ku nyamusi dave." Mukali wu mwami lwa yahulila ndio yanyola liegosa kijira oyo mu mwoyo gwegwe yalola Nyamusi yamala kukutsa lwa yatsia mu mulitu musigari yamwita. Yanyola mwoyo mulidoho lwa yahulila cherolo kimuvolela Nyamusi akikili mwoyo. Si yenya ku ahulili mukali undi aveye ni ligondo lilahi kumuvita dave. Yaganagana vudiku vwosi kuli anyala kokola yite Nyamusi. Yamanya navuka asubui niyivika tsinguvu tsia madaradari nagada agulitsa visanwa vilahi viu kusanula masu. Yatanga logendo lwu kutsia mulitu kusagala Nyamusi ku nangwa amwite. Yagenda logendo yilwo lutambi yaduka hi inyumba ya Nyamusi yali naveye mu. Yatanga kulangilitsa agulitsa visanwa via masu. Nyamusi lwa yahulila mwoyo gwu mundu ni gulangilitsa, yigula lidilisha nahenzelamu. Yalola kakele kasamuku kalangilitsa kagulitsa visanwa. Yamanya naganagana mu mwoyo, "ae, kakere kasamuku kuli yaka kanyala kongola kindu kidamanu kweli? Kali niva manani gangayi mbuli kwigula muliango, kakere yaka kaveye ku na mang'ana dave kandi kangola kindu chosi dave." Yamanya niyigula muliango mukere niyingila mmba na muvolela ngulitsa visanwa. Nyamusi yafola ku kisanwa kilala cha yalola ni kimuyanzitsa. Mukere ula yamuvolela leta ngusanule lisu lyolyo. Ngani mukere ula kisanwa kila yali navachi ku isumu. Lwa yasanula mu mutwi, yamutsoma ligali mu mutwi vudinyu ku nangwa isumu yila nigenda mu muvili. Nyamusi yagwa hasi nakinda. Mukere yasuvila Nyamusi akutsi natiguka tsimbilu yilana wayamenya. Ku vulahi hamugolova hali nai hakaduka kandi isa ya manani yo kogelela yali ni yakaduka kutula mu luhitsi. Manani lwa gingila mmba niganyola Nyamusi agwiyi hasi akutsi. Gamuhutsahutsa Nyamusi yamanya nasimuguka. Yagivalila kuli kakere kakera katsi ni kagada kagulitsa visanwa ma nikamutotsa ni kisanwa mu mutwi na ngani yali navachi ku isumu. Manani gamanya nigamuvolela atigula ku muliango lidiku kandi dave. Mukali wu mwami naye lwa yatiguka tsimbilu natsia yanyagula naduka natsia paga tsa mu cherolo cheche kijira mwoyo gwegwe gwamuvolela yakwita mukana ula. Naketeva mateva ga vuli kase navutsa cherolo chamuvolela Nyamusi akilitsa mwoyo kandi akemenyanga. Mukali uyu yalega ligali mu mwoyo gwegwe na anyola vutima, yanyola mwoyo gwe imbodoka ni gumemdeka mu ye. Yaganagana inzila yindi ya anyala kwita Nyamusi. Yavugula litunda lilahi ling'eleng'anu na akala mu hagati. Luvega lulala navaka ku isumu kandi na luvega lkundi lula naleka luva ndio. Yasimuka kandi natsia mu mulitu kutsia kusagala mukana uyu yenya amwite. Yaduka hango yaho natanga kandi lilangilitsa agulitsa matunda. Nyamusi yahenzela kandi mwidilisha nalola mukere agulitsa kandi matunda. Litunda liene lila liali lilahi kandi liu kuyanzitsa. Yituluka mate mu munwa gwigwe ni yegomba kulia litunda liene lila ndi. Yamanya niyitsulitsa manani gamuvoleye avuli gwigula muliango navutsa litundda lila liali liu kuyanzitsa ligali muno kandi mwoyo gwegwe gwenya lihali kulilia. Mukere yingila mmba namuha litunda. Nyamusi yasula kuvugula litunda navutsa mukere yamuvolela "awa, utatia kuvugula dave, litunda tsa ndi liveye lilhahi. Inze ndalia luvega lulala na inze ndalia luvega  lundi." Mukere yavugula luvega lwatali ku ni isumu na atanga kulia. Nyamusi yamanya nalola "uu ku mukere uyu sa alitsa lilye, leka kali na yinze ndie liange." navutswa lwa yaluma ku lyelye tsa munwa gwu kutanga namila, litunda lila liahanda hidundu limumiga, si yamanya namila dave. Yagwa hasi kandi nakinda. Mukere lwa yayola ndio, yatiguka tsimbiru namanya Nyamusi yakukutsa. Yanyagura ligali natsia na lwayaduka mmba mwimwe kindu chu kutanga chalange kutsia mu cherolo cheche kuketeva mateva ga vuli kase, "cherolo change mu vakali vosi vo losoma yilu, ni mukali ki uveye ni ligondo lilahi kuvita vosi?" Cherolo chamuvolela niye aveye ni ligondo lilahi. Mukali oyo lwa yahulila ndio yayanza kijira yalola Nyamusi yakukutsa. Manani lwa gatsa hamugolova, ganyola Nyamusi akutsi. Gali no voveleli ligali muno. Gamanya ni galomba lisandugu lilahi lie vierolo nigamuvika mu ma nigamuvika ku kigulu ligali. Vuli lidiku nigavita nigatsia mu luhitsi gamulolela ahene yaho kijira gali no voveleli ligali Nyamusi kukutsa na yali mulina wavo ligali; yavayinzilila miyinzi milahi. Gamanya gamuvika hene hala ku kigulu gamulolelange ho vuli diku. Nyamusi yamenya mu lisandugu yilio mu kigulu ku mihiga miinyinge. Yafwana kuli akikili mwoyo navutsa yali nai yakutsa. Manani gamulinda vudiku na mmbasu ku nangwa mundu avuli kumwiva dave. Liali ho lidiku lilala mwana muyayi wu mwami wi kivala kindi yali navita  hakigulu hene yaho. Yalola mukana mulahi wi ligondo nitali aveye mu lisandugu. Mwana muyayi oyo yali ni ligenya. Lwa yisunda ho shimbe, yamanya nanyola ho manani galindi  ho. Yamanya nagateva "kijira kindiki mukana mulahi wi ligondo lilahi ndio aveye mu lisandugu?" Manani gamuvolela mukana oyo yamala kukutsa. Muyayi yali no vovelei nitali yamanya navolela manani gala, "kali niva yakutsa, inze mumbe mukana wene uyu naveye tsa ndio mwisandugu. manani gasula gamuvolela "a a, uyu yali mulina witu mulahi ligali kandi kwamuyanza ligali. Kwamenya naye mihiga minyinge vulahi na sukunyala kukuha dave. kali kwalinda tsa yaha ndi nangwa mundu avuli kumwiva dave." Muyayi oyo yagonya manani gala ligali nagovolela "nu muyanza mumbe inze nzie kuvika mwana mukana uyu yengo wange kali niva yakutsa ndamuhenza vutsa ave yengo wange." Manani gamanya ni gavugilila mukana oyo Nyamusi na kijira kwali ku kigulu, muyayi oyo yatuma vasigari veve vanine ku kiguru kwene kula vatsie kwikitsa lisandugu lia Nyamusi yalimu. Lwa vali nivikitsa,  kijira vali ku kigulu, vasigari vala visigatila ku magina, lisandugu liabutsuka mu makono gavo niligwa hasi nilibomokana. Muvili gwa Nyamusi gwatula mu nigugwa haluvega. Kemego chi lidunda chali nichamenya hidundu chasila niklitulila mmunwa. Nyamusi yasimuguka niyikala, nakunula tsimoni tsitsye, nateva nu mwoyo gwa garaha "mbeye hayi?" vasigari vegosa kolola mukutsu namoloma na yali yakutsa mihiga minyinge. Viruka tsimbiru tsinene ligali muno ni valeka manani gala halala nu muyayi wenya muvili gwa Nyamusi nivakisingiyi. Muyayi wu mwami ula yali nu vuyanzi lugali muno kolola Nyamusi nasimuguchi. Yamugimila mukono namuvolela "kali niva ni wali niwakutsa kolondekana nu mwoyo mudamanu gwa mama waovo wa kambo, inze ndakumala kukuyanza na ndaklushila komenya nive, hamba kutsie yengo nive ngushile munyumba mwa baba wange, akohe tsingavi tsitsye, koletane, kokole keselo, uve mukaye wange. Nyamusi lwa yahulila ndio yali nu vuyanzi ligali muno. Yayanza na vamanya ni vatanga logendo ni vatsia yengo wanga muyayi ula.

<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Chief and his wife</p>
<p>My name is Maiden Kasambai and I am going to tell you a story about a girl who was beautiful.</p>
<p>We had a chief who had a wife. They stayed well in this world and they led the people in the right manner. His rein pleased people in that land. During the second harvest the second year, the chief and the wife received baby girl. It was joy to the chief and the wife with the people in the land that he was ruling. This girl was beautiful. She was as white as snow. She had long hair that was black in color and it was reaching her shoulders. </p>
<p>This girl had beauty that pleased all the people and her relatives. The following year, something bad happened to the ruling of this chief. The wife to the chief who was the mother to this child died. When she died some people mourned about her demise. But the chief married another woman. This is the woman who came to take care of this girl who was called Nyamusi; she was like her stepmother. She was a woman a heartless woman. She treated this child roughly and gave her tough work. The chief was not pleased with such conditions but he perservired with the situation of the wife.</p>
<p>They stayed like that for many years. This woman continued to treat the girl with jelousness. This girl was beautiful and the wife of the chief had a mirror that you see yourself through after dressing and ready to go out to walk. She had kept the mirror on the wall where she sleeps. Before she goes out she used to look herself in the mirror, after bathing, and also to confirm that she has dressed well and do corrections on her dressing and makeup. This mirror had the intelligence of speaking like the bird that we call owl. After she had viewd herself in the mirror and ready to go out, the owl used to speak. She used to go there, then she begins to speak "my good mirror on the wall; among all the women in this rein of the chief, who is a good woman with beauty, who pleases all people?" the mirror used to answer her "ooh! The wife of the chief; among all the women there is no beautiful woman like you, you are the one who is beautiful than the rest" whenever she heard this she was pleased. She had a jealous heart and she didn't want to hear any other woman in that village is more beautiful than her. She stayed like that for many years, whenever she wanted to leave she could go and ask the mirror "I am asking you my mirror which woman is has more beauty than me? " the mirror used to answer her the way she wanted. Whenever she heard that, she felt happy with great joy. </p>
<p>One day the woman asked her mirror the common question "my mirror on the wall, among all the women in this village who is beautiful than others?" the mirror agreed and said the good wife of the chief, among all the women you are the one who has beauty, but today I want to tell you the truth, I swear Nyamusi is the one who has the true beauty than all other women." When this woman heard that she was not pleased with those words. She watched Nyamusi keenly and she realized that she had true beauty. She became jealous the whole night and day time. She called one of the policemen and asked him to take Nyamusi to the middle of the forest and kill her then leave her there. She didn't want to see her. The policeman took Nyamusi to the forest. When the policeman took out his knife ready to kill her, Nyamusi began to scream and she asked him not to kill him instead he leave her and she will not return home. The policeman saw Nyamusi crying and he felt pitty for her. </p>
<p>He returned the knife and told Nyamusi to run very fast, to prevent the wild animals from attacking him. Nyamusi ran very fast. She ran very fast, for three days without seeing any house, or meeting any wild animal. She crossed rivers, she went through bushes, and stones cut her legs. Thorns torned her clothes but she didn't give up. She continued to run because she didn't want to return back to her home because of her jelousy stepmother. This woman could even hung or kill her. She continued to run so that she could find a place where she could stay and be alive. She didn't meet any wild animal that could harm her. The fourth day she was tired, her legs had swollen, clothes were torned, and thorns had pierced her legs. The good thing is that she saw a beautiful house that was on a hill. She was tired but she tried and reached the beautiful house that was on the hill. She knocked the door but nobody was responding to her. She pushed the door and opened the house and she entered inside. </p>
<p>When she looked around the house she saw wonders. The seating room had been arranged well. The table had seven plates full of meals. There were seven knives and spoons, but those things were short they were not long like the normal ones. Folks were there, and porridge was there on the gourd. Meals had been arranged on the table. When she moved near she saw seven beds, they had been arranged well. Nyamusi was very tired since she had run for four days. She was very hungry and thirsty. She was afraid of eating the meals that were arranged in this house. She took small portion of each meal so that when the owners come they should not realize that someone ate their meals. The porridge that was on the gourd, she took a little of it. She also took the water after eating the meals since she was thirsty. She went to rest after eating and she slept. She slept since she was tired. Little did she know that the house belonged to seven ogres? In the evening, the ogres came back to their house; they used to walk on the hills the whole day looking for what to eat. They used to walk and look for food; they also looked for animals to hunt. </p>
<p>In the evening one of the ogres said, "I am smelling the meat of a person," another ogre said like that until all of them did that. When they got into the house they lit a stick for light since it was dark. The first ogre looked at the table and shouted, "who ate my food" the other six ogres looked at their meals and saw that someone had eaten it. They also looked at the gourd, which had the porridge, and they saw that someone had drunk it. All of them started making noise and sensed that someone was inside their house. They looked even under the table, under the bed and they didn't see anyone. One of the ogres asked the others to come and see the person who was lying on his bed. </p>
<p>Others ran and found a beautiful girl lying on the bed of the little ogre. One of the ogres suggested that they eat her. Others said "no we cannot eat such a beautiful girl" they left the place slowly since they didn't want to wake her up, they went and sat on the table then they started taking their meals. They drank their porridge then they went and slept. The little ogre that Nyamusi had slept on his bed went and slept near her feet. When Nyamusi woke up in the morning she was surprised to see the seven ogres. The ogres asked her not to be afraid they asked her name and she told them that she was called Nyamusi. </p>
<p>They asked her how she got to their place because people were not found near the place. Nyamusi told them how her stepmother treated her roughly, until she reached somewhere and asked one of the policemen to slaughter her, and the policeman had mercy on her and that is why she reached their house. The ogres had mercy on her. The elder ogre told her that she was a girl of good heart and she was very beautiful.  </p>
<p>They told her that they eat people that they wont eat her. They want her to stay with them, cook food for them as they go to hunt meat in the forest. She assists by cleaning their house, wash dishes and clothes and also cleans the compound. Nyamusi was very happy when she heard the ogres saying that, and she knew that her stepmother wouldn't find and kill her. When the ogres left the house in the morning they asked her not to open the door for anyone. She was pleased to stay with the ogres on the forest. The ogres used to find everything well arranged in the evening when they came. And on the other side the mother knew that Nyamusi was dead. And now she also felt that there was no other woman who was beautiful than her. She remembered and went to ask the mirror the normal questions, she went to the mirror that normaly speaks and she asked it "oh, my good mirror among all the women in this village who is more beautiful than the rest?" the mirror responded and said "you the good wife of the chief, I tell you that Nyamusi is not dead she is in the forest staying with ogres even if you have a beautiful skin, you cannot compete with Nyamusi." When she heard that she was astonished, because she knew in her heart that Nyamusi was dead when she went with the policeman, he killed her. </p>
<p>She was depressed when she heard the mirror telling her that Nyamusi was still alive. She didn't want to hear that there was another woman who was more beautiful than her. She figured out the whole night ways of killing Nyamusi. In the morning she put on torned clothes claiming that she was selling combs. She started the journey to the forest, to go and look for Nyamusi, and also kill her. She went through the long journey and arrived where the house of Nyamusi was and she called out saying that she was selling combs. Nyamusi saw a dirty woman calling out that she was selling combs. She thought for a while and wondered if a small old woman like her could do anything to her. Even if the ogres have warned me against opening the door, this woman has no issues and she cannot do me anything. She opened the door and the woman entered into the house and told her that she was selling combs. Nyamusi checked on one comb that she felt was pleasing to her. The woman asked her to allow her to comb her hair. The woman had applied poison on the comb and she pierced it into Nyamusi head, and Nyamusi fell down and fainted. The woman thought that Nyamusi was dead and she ran very fast to where she was staying, the good thing is that evening was nearing and the time for the ogres to leave the hunting place had come. When the ogres entered the house and found that Nyamusi had fainted they blew air on her and she came back to life.   </p>
<p>She explained to them how an old woman came and lied to her that she was selling combs, and she pierced her into the head, and the comb had poison. The ogres warned her not to open the door another day. The wife of the chief ran straight away to the mirror because her heart told her that she had killed Nyamusi. She asked the mirror the normal questions but the mirror told her that Nyamusi was still alive and she was living. This woman was annoyed and she became jelous. She thought of another way of killing Nyamusi. She took another sweet fruit and she cut it in the middle. She applied poison on one side and she left the other side. She left and went to the forest to look for this girl that she wanted to kill her. She arrived at the home and she called out that she was selling fruits. </p>
<p>Nyamusi looked through the window and she saw the woman with a fruit that was attractive. She salivated and wished to eat the fruit. She remembered what the ogres told her but the fruit was attractive and she wanted to eat it. The woman entered the house and gave her the fruit. Nyamusi refused to take the fruit. The woman asked her not to fear, the fruit was good. She told her that she will eat one side and Nyamusi to eat the other side. The woman took the part that didn't have poison and she ate, Nyamusi saw that the woman was eating her part, she took the other part and she began to eat, when she bited the fruit, it stuck at the throat and she didn't swallow, she fell down and fainted. When the woman saw that she knew that Nyamusi was dead. And when she ran the first thing was to go to her mirror to ask it the normal questions. "My mirror; among all these women in this village, who is more beautiful than me " the mirror told her that she was the one who was beautiful. When she heard that she was happy because she knew that Nyamusi was dead.</p>
<p>When the ogres came in the eveing they found out that Nyamusi was dead. They were sorrowful. They made a coffin of glasses then they kept her inside and put her on top of a hill. Everyday when they went to hunt they used to see her there because Nyamusi was their best friend, she worked for them, they kept her on top of the hill so that they see her everyday. Nyamusi stayed in that coffin on top of a hill for many years. She seemed to be alive but she was dead. The ogres looked after her day and night so that someone cannot steal her.</p>
<p>One day the son of an elder of another village was passing by the hill, and he saw a beautiful girl who was in the coffin, the boy was surprised and when he moved near he found ogres looking after the girl inside the coffin. He asked the ogres why the beautiful girl was inside the coffin, and the ogres told him that the girl was dead. The boy was sorrowful and he asked the ogres to give him the girl the way she is in the coffin. The ogres refused and told him that Nyamusi was their best friend and they loved her so much.</p>
<p>Kwamenya naye mihiga minyinge vulahi na sukunyala kukuha dave. kali kwalinda tsa yaha ndi nangwa mundu avuli kumwiva dave." Muyayi oyo yagonya manani gala ligali nagovolela "nu muyanza mumbe inze nzie kuvika mwana mukana uyu yengo wange kali niva yakutsa ndamuhenza vutsa ave yengo wange." Manani gamanya ni gavugilila mukana oyo Nyamusi na kijira kwali ku kigulu, muyayi oyo yatuma vasigari veve vanine ku kiguru kwene kula vatsie kwikitsa lisandugu lia Nyamusi yalimu. Lwa vali nivikitsa,  kijira vali ku kigulu, </p>
<p>They told him that they have stayed with her for many years and they cannot give him. And they are guarding the place so that no one can steal the body. The boy asked them to give him the girl to take her to his home even if she is dead, he will stay with her at his home. The ogres allowed the boy to take the girl, and the boy asked his policemen to go and pick the coffin from the top of the hill, while they were bring it down they remained on the hill and the coffin rolled down and broke into peaces. The dead body of Nyamusi came out and remained aside. The part of the fruit that she had bitten came out, Nyamusi rose into life again, she opened her eyes and asked where she was? The policemen were astonished to see the dead speaking and yet she had died for many years. They ran away very fast and they left the son of the elder who wanted Nyamusi. He was very happy to see Nyamusi alive again. He told her even if she was dead because of the jealous stepmother he has loved her and he wants to stay with her. "Come I take you to my fathers house, he give you the blessing, we get married do wedding and you be my wife" the boy said. Nyamusi was happy when she heard that, and they began the journey to the home of the boy. A big wedding was organized and many visitors came, the stepmother of Nyamusi was among the visitors. </p>
<p>On the day of the wedding the stepmother to Nyamusi bathed and put on a beautiful dress for the wedding. But whe she wanted to leave she went to her mirror and asked it the normal questions, "my good mirror among all the women in this village who is more beautiful than the rest?" the mirror said "Oh the wife of the chief, you have a beautiful skin but in reality I swear, the bride who is going to do wedding today is the one who has beautiful skin than others" these words made the wife of the chief to feel bad in her heart. She was not happy, she thought of not going to the wedding, but she decided to go and see this woman that was more beautiful than her. </p>
<p>She began the journey to the wedding. When she arrived there, she was astonished to find that the girl who was wedding was Nyamusi, the one that she wanted to kill. She thought that she was dead, for the past years, when she observed her keenly she saw that she was Nyamusi, she fell down and fainted, they carried her home, while on the way she died and my story ends there. This story is teaching us that we should not be jelous because of our young ones we love one another if you see someones child take her as your child.</p>
