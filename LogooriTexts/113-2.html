Engoko yamenya hasi ni liive igulu mu malesi navutsa engoko mu ma,diku gene gala yali nu vunyali vwu kuburuka itsie ku igulu yila kandi yilana hasi. Vayinzila tsigasi tsiavo halala kandi mu vuhambani vuveye vu kusuvulitsana. Valutana vuli kase; liive liatula igulu yila litsa hasi hano kogendela engoko kandi engoko nayo lwa maholu nagagilie niiburuke nitsie kogendela ku liive igulu yila kijira yali nu vunyali vwu kubruka. Miyinzi jiavo vayinzila halala kandi nu vuguru vunyinge ligali muno. Vali vayanzana ligali vasavana ijumbi kali vinulana tsingutsa. Vali vakola kali vufuva; engoko ni yala ni igasi, liive liatsa kumukonya kandi lwa liive na liive ni igasi kandi engoko niburuke nitsie igulu yila nitsie kumukonya. Vulina vwavo vwali vulahi ligali muno kandi vwayanzitsa avalina na vatende kandi na manyonyi gandi gosi. Vamenya ndio nu vuyanzi ku mihiga mitambi. Lidiku lilala engoko halala nu musakulu weve  idaywa vaduka ku linyola avana vavo. Engoko yalula viminyo saba na yayanza ligali. Yamanya nitumana mang'ana ku mulina weve naveye liive yatse kolola ku avana veve. Liive lwa liatsa ni lilolaku avana yava ve engoko liali nu vuyanzi ligali kolola ku avana vu mulina weve. Kijira avana ve engoko vali ni vaveye avalahi ligali muno; ni viveye viminyu. Viali na mavaha malahi agavumolomonde kandi viali na mangilinya ku mitwi jiavo; viafwana kuli mukana nasuchi lisu lilye. Liive liamanya ni liegomba viminyu vie engoko. Liamanya liganagana ,mu mwoyo ni livola kali yinze kuduka nyole ku avana vange valahi kuli ve engoko. Kandi liive nu musakulu weve vamanya ni vanyola avana vavo saba. liive lialanga engoko kandi kijira vali valina; niiburuka nitsia igulu nitsia nelolaku ku avana veve. Engoko ni liive vamenya mu vuyanzi ni milembe mihiga minyinge. Vakonyana ku miyinzi jiavo kandi ni valinda avana vavo vulahi kuli mundu alinda avana veve. Liive liasinga avana veve mu inzila iveye indahi; livaraga masy kandi livakalaga masand. Engoko nayo yasinga avana navutsa siyavavega masu nu kukaraga masanda dave. Masu ga avana ve engoko gali gayumba halal na masanda gali gatambiha. Lidiku lilala lialiho engoko yaburuka nitsia igulu kusava liive munyu mukereka. Lwa yaduka yo, yanyola liive lisinji avana va lio vanishi vulahi ligali muno; livaveji masu kandi livakalaji masanda. Engoko yateva liive,"kindiki chutumikili kunihitsa avana vovo ligali ndi ku nangwa uduchi kali kuvakala amasanda kandi livaraga masu?" Liive liamuvolela nadukutumikila lugembe. Engoko yasaya liive limuheku lugembe lwe yilu kandi nayo istie kukaragila viminyu via yo amasanda. Kijira vali valina ligali na vali vayanzana liive liamanya ni livugilila kumuha logembe lwene yilwo. Liamuha munyu mukereka gwa yali ni yitsi kusava kandi limuha logembe. Navutsa liamuvolela "nuyanza mwatsa utagotitsa dave." Engoko yam,anya nivugilila nivugula logembe ma nitanga logendo lwu kuburuka kwilana hasi ni vindu via yali nitula kusava. Navutsa lwa yali niyakaduka mu malesi hagati, logembe lwanotsoka mu makono lotonya hasi. Engoko yamanya niburuka tsimbiru vwangu vwangu niiduka hasi vwangu nitanga kusagala logembe halutonyi. Yasagala tsisaa tsindambi navutswa siyanyola dave. Avana ve engoko viakuba tsikwili kijira viahulila inzala ni vienya chukulia navutsa engoko yatsitsagilila kusagala logembe ligali muno. Avana valinda mama wavo naveye engoko adeke tsingutsa nu munyu gwa yatsi nagwo arugi vuchima varagili navutsa engoko yatsitsagilila kusagala logembe kijira yali ni lihenda mwoyo lugembe lwali lwi liive na limanya liitse kuteva na lwakumala kogota. Yasagala ni vilenge via yo kali nu munwa gwa yo. Yasagala vuli havundu hosi kali mu magomia, mulimi navutsa si yanyola logembe dave. Madiku gavita manyinge engoko nisagala logembe siyanyola dave. Yatsitsagilila kusagala vudiku na mmbasu kijira yahenda mwoyo liive limanya litse kuteva logembe lwa lio. Madiku gavita manyinge na liive avana va lio masanda ni gayumba, lisu ni litambiha ku mutwi; sasa liduka havundu lienya logembe lwa lio linihitsile avana va lio. Liive lialinda engoko ilete logembe na engoko yaleta dave. Liive liamanya ni lilega muno. Liaburuka ni lika hasi yengo we engoko. Lianyola engoko ku ihandaliyi mu lisagala, ni yihuya; itsia mmba, itula mu; itsia mu magoomia isagalanyia mu, itulamu; itsia mu mulimi isagala mu kandi itula mu; kandi yilana mmba isagala kali ni mwigoke navutsa awa, logembe luvula. Liive liavolela engoko nadukutsa kuvugula logembe lwange; avana vange masu gayumbe kandi masanda gatambihi; ndenya kutsia kuvavega kandi kuvagaraga masanda. Engoko yavolela liive linda ngukavili. Yatsitsagilila kukava na liive ni lilinda. Lialinda nililinda kuduka lialuha. Liive liamanya limuvolela "onzenyere logembe vwangu ombe, manya nzilane hamugolova na nutamba dave, ndavugula mwana wovo mulala nzie kulia. Liamanya liburuka litsia yengo wa lio. Engoko nayo yatsitsagilila kusagala logembe ni tsingulu tsiosi. Yasagalanyia kali mu madali ga avana vayo ga yali nivagaye kuduka ni gatanduka ni kava logembe navutsa yanyola dave. Hamurova yaduka liive lilana litsa koteva logembe lwa lio. Liive liateva engoko "mbe logembe lwange" Engoko yajiba dave, yatsitsagilila kusaganyia.

Engoko yatigala nikuba tsikwili nilangilila avana vali nivatigaye sita nivavisa mu tsimbaha kandi mugamba asubui engoko yavuka tsa nitanga lisagala logembe. Yamanya liive limanya lilane koteva logembe lwa lio. Yasagala ni tsingulu navutsa yanyola dave. Hamugolova lwa yaduka, liive lilana koteva logembe. Engoko yatamwa kujiba yatsitsagilila kusagala. Liive lyikuba ku kiminyo ni litsia kulia na avana veve. Vatsigilila ndio engoko yavuka tsa vuli subui itanga kusagala logembe na liive nalio lwa litsa linyola logembe luvula liadola kiminyo che engoko lyiluka nacho. Vamanya vaduka havundu vava vasigu. Engoko gamanyikanga nihulila liive ni litsa yalange nu vuti. Liive liasomba viminyu vila viosi kuduka ni vifwa viosi pe. Engoko yamanya nitigala enzele vujila viminyu navutsa liive silialuha kutsa kuteva logembe lwa lio dave. Vamanya vagwa vasigu vanene sasa. Lwa liali liakamala viminyu viosi kandi liatanga kuhima nyina mwene. Ku engoko naiyahulila liive nilitsa, yiluka itsia kwivisa munyumba anoho itsia kubama mu kitinya chi ligomia. Icho kivune kijira kali na kalunu liive nilitsa kudaya logembe lwa lio ma linyola engoko ikikili konyola, livugula kiminyo cho kivune liive livugula viminyo vie engoko kandi nicho kivube kijira engoko nisagala vuli havundu hosi, mu magomia, mwigoke, mu mulimi, mu masingo, kali nu madali nu vagaye kijira evetsanga nikava logembe lwi liive ku nangwa liive livuli kuhila viminyo via yo anoho livuli kugilia eyo yene.

<p>Lugano lwange lufwere hene yaho.</p>
<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Chief and his wife</p>
<p>Long time ago hen and eagle were best friends, the hen was living down on the ground and the eagle was up in the sky. Those days the hen had the ability to fly to up, and also return back. They did there work well, in unity. Evrytime the eagle used to fly down to visit the hen and when the hen missed the eagle, she used to fly and visit the eagle up because she had the ability to fly. They did their work together in unity. They loved one another and they used to borrow one another salt and vegetables. They even had duties whenever the hen had a lot of work the eagle used to fly down and assist the hen, and when the eagle had work the hen used to fly up and offer assistance to the eagle. Their friendship was good and it pleased their friends, neighbors and other birds.</p>
<p>They stayed like that with happiness for many years. One day the hen together with her husband mr cock, they got children. The hen gave birth to seven chicks and she was very happy. She sent information to her best friend who was eagle to come and see her children. When the eagle came to see the hen's children she was very happy to see her friends children. Because the hen's children were good and they were chicks. They had good wings with beautiful colors on their head; they looked like when a girl has made her hair. The eagle wished to have the children of the hen. She thought and told herself that she needs to have children like those of the hen. The eagle together with her husband received seven children too. The eagle invited the hen because they were best friends; she flew up and went to see the children of the eagle. The hen and the eagle stayed in happiness for many years. They assisted one another, and took good care of their children the way someone takes care of her children.</p>
<p>The eagle bathed her children in the right way, she cut down their hair and nails, the hen bathed her children but it didn't cut their hair and nails. The hair had overgrow together with their nails. One day the hen flew and went to borrow the eagle soda ash. When she got there she found that the eagle had cleaned her children and they were very clean, she had cut their hair together with their nails. She asked the eagle what she had used to clean her children, until she had cut their nails together with their hair. The eagle told her that she had used razor blade. The hen borrowed the eagle the razor blade so that she could go and cut her children nails. Since they were friends, and they loved one another, the eagle agreed to give her the razor blade. She gave her the soda ash that she had come to borrow and the razor blade too. But she pleaded her not to loose the razor blade. </p>
<p>The hen agreed and she took the razor blade and she began the journey to fly down together with the things that she had borrowed. But when she was at the middle of the journey from the sky, the razor blade fell off from her hands. The hen flew very fast and she reached down and began to look for the razor blade where it had fallen. She looked for many hours but she didn't see. Her children began to scream because they were hungry but the hen continued to look for the razor blade. The children waited for their mother who was hen to cook veetables using the soda ash that she had borrowed and also bake maize flour for them to eat but the hen continued to look for the razor blade, she was afraid because the razor blade belonged to the eagle and she could come for it at any time and ask and the razor blade had lost. She searched for it using her legs and the beak. She looked for it everywhere even in the banana plantation, on the farm but she didn't find it. Many days passed without the hen getting the razor blade. She continued to look for it day and night because she was afraid that the eagle would come to ask for her razor blade. And the eagle's children had long nails, with overgrown hair, she reached a place and wanted her razor blade to clean her children (by cutting their nails and the hair) the eagle waited for the hen to bring back the razor blade but she didn't. The eagle became angry; she flew down to the home of the hen. She found the hen busy searching for it. The hen was getting into the house then outside, she was going to the banana plantation looking for the razor blade. She was going to the farm to look for it she was going to the house even in the ash; the razor blade was not there. </p>
<p>The eagle told the hen that she had come to take her razor blade; her children had long hair together with nails. And she wanted to go and shave their hair and cut their nails. The hen asked the eagle to wait she look the razor blade for her. She continued to look for it as the eagle waited. She waited until she got tired. The eagle asked her to look the razor blade ery fast and give her. She will return in the evening and if she does not give her the razor blade she will take one of the children and eat her. She flew back to her home. The hen continued to look for the razor blade with more efforts. She looked even under the bed of her children. But she did not find it.</p>
<p>In the evening the eagle came back to ask for her razor blade, the eagle asked the hen to give her razor blade, the hen didn't answer the hen continued to search for it, when the eagle saw that the hen was not speaking she picked one of the chicks and she flew, and went to eat the chick together with her children from her home. The hen remained screaming and she called the remaining six children and she covered them with her wings, the following morning the hen continued to look for the razor blade. She knew that the eagle would return to ask for her razor blade. She searched with more efforts but she didn't find it. In the evening the eagle returned to ask for the blade. The hen lacked what to answer and she continued to look for it. The eagle took another chick and she went to eat, together with her children. They continued like that, the hen used to wake up and look for the blade and the eagle used to come, and take one chick since the razor blade was not found. They to a point and they became enemies. Whenever the hen heard that the eagle was coming she was afraid, the eagle took all the chicks until they were finished. The hen remained without chicks but the eagle didn't cease from coming to ask for her razor blade. They became great enemies, after finishing all the chicks she began to hunt her mother, whenever the hen heard that the eagle was coming she used to go and hide in the house or on the banana sack. That is the reason to why when the eagle comes to ask for the razor blade she finds that the hen has not found it. That is the reason to why the eagle takes the chick and the hen is ever searching for the razor blade in the banana plantation, ash, on the farm, in the cowdung, even in the beddings when you have taken them out to dry, because she is looking for the razor blade, so that the eagle can stop taking away her chicks or take her away. My story ends there.</p>
<p>I AM GOING TO TELL YOU THE REASON TO WHY WILD ANIMALS RUN AWAY WHEN THEY SEE PEOPLE:</p>
<p>Long time agolion was the king of the jungle. All the animals had strong unity. And when the lion was ruling them they were very happy. They didn't defy any rule because he was their ruler. They did all the work that the king wanted them to do, in unity and also in great agreement. One day the king held a meeting for all the animals that stay in the jungle, because he wanted to give them new rules. The king appointed the elephant because he has long horn to stand on a hill and call all the animals, to hear his voice so that they can come to sit for the meeting. The elephant followed the instructions from the king who was the lion. He called the other animals in a loud voice. Within a short period of time they assembeled together at the place of the meeting the way the king had organized. </p>
<p>The animals that came for the meeting were many and they were all wild animals. The elephant was there, giraffe, hare, chameleon, wild dog, mole, bird, chimpanzee and snakes. The king told the animals that they were aware that he was their leader and the leader of all the animals that stay in water. He was the one ruling over all the animals. "So all of you should obey my rules and follow them, you hold them in the right way the way you are supposed to do, he added; from today I am going to assign each one of you the work that you should be doing" he told the hare "you will be my guard and you will ensure that the rest of the animals are doing their work well, and if there will be an animal that is not doing the work in the right manner, you will come to tell me as the king" other animals like the dog and the cheeter were given the work of sweeping and cleaning the whole forest. When the dog heard the king saying that he shouted and said that he wont do the work that he was given. When the king heard the words from the dog, he asked the elephant to catch the dog and bring him where he was very fast. The elephant brought the dog to him and he asked to be brought a long stick. He asked the dog to lie down; he gave the dog many strokes of cane, they were like one hundred. The dog cried and the lion continued to punish him. He asked the dog to stand up and bow before him ten times. He did like that and he didn't make the noise again. He did the work that he was given. The elephant was assigned to make road in the forest. He was supposed to remove trees and stumps. So that when the king will walk he should not stamble.</p>
<p>Since the giraffe has a long neck he was asked to watch around, if the enemies are coming and also to look for good animals that the king can eat. Since he has a long neck, he had the ability to look around the world easily. When the meeting was nearing the end, the king said that he has some difficultie and he wanted to hand over the work but he had not seen the person. He will not be attending the meeting. He asked all the animals to figure out ways of using to make him be feared by all the animals. The cheeter stood and said since people are the enemies of the animals. They are also feared and when they see the animals they hunt and eat them. If one is caught he should be plucked off the eyes, so that he should not see. The cheetar seconded by saying that is the best way to make people fear lion and give him respect over the other animals. The hyena said that someone should be given a lot of food to eat. So that he get defeated from running away and not kill animals. </p>
<p>Everyone was to suggest his/her ideas that can make all the people to fear the lion who is the king of the jungle. As time passed the animals suggested their ideas. Since the giraffe is tall, he saw people coming from far. He told the lion that he had seen people coming and they were carrying swords and they wanted to kill the animals. The king asked all the animals to go and hide themselves in the bushes. All the animals ran away and hide themselves the meeting ended there, without coming out with ways to make people know that lion was their king. That is the reason to why whenever the wild animals see someone coming they run away because someone can catch and cut them with sword and spear. My story has ended there.</p>
<p>I AM GOING TO TELL YOU THE REASONS TO WHY THE FROGS MAKE NOISE WHEN THEY ARE IN WATER:</p>
<p>Long time ago all the water, well, lakes and rivers were ruled by frogs. The frogs were staying at peace in water. All the water from the rain belonged to the frogs. Fish and other things that stayed in water were to pay fine so that they live in that water, because they didn't allow other animals to stay in their water. For other animals to stay in they had to pay tax. Even the cows and other animals in the forest had to pay, for them to drink the water that belonged to the frogs. One day all the frogs called one another and they discussed on adding the payments for water. The elder of the frogs told the other frogs that they should know that the water belongs to all of them. We are the heads and for other animals to use the water they have to pay. The frogs called all the animals on the forest together with the other frogs. </p>
<p>The elder of the frogs told the animal's thata they have stayed for many years, giving them clean water that is sweet as they drink. But they are not paying them enough money. Some of the animals like cows and elephants are taking more water, they can even finish their water. So we as the frogs we have decided to adjust on the payments that you normaly give. We are starting today and you will be paying twice as much as you normaly pay. </p>
<p>All the wild animals murmured and said that they cannot pay at those rates. The elder of the frogs stood and said since they have refused to follow his rules, they wont drink their water again. Or else they agree to pay twice the normal rate. Hare shouted and said "you frog you are a small animal, from today we the wild animals will drink the water for free without paying anything" when the other animals heard the hare saying that they stood up and shouted that they will drink water for free and they wont pay anything, the animals shouted those words as they went to the forest.</p>
<p>The elder of the frogs remained wondering what to do. The frogs' thought of ways that they could use to make the animals pay twice as much as they used to pay. One of the frogs stood and suggested that they light fire around the water, so that the water becomes warm. So that the animals cannot drink until they pay for it, the frogs went to the forest and fetched a lot of firewood and arranged them around the water then they lit a huge fire. But the water didn't get warm. The animals continued to drink water without paying anything. The frogs thought of another idea to prevent the animals from drinking the water. They told one another to dig the place, so that the animals may not be able to drink the water because the water will have gone down. They took the shovel and they began to dig, they dug until the water went down. All the animals were unable to drink the water but the giraffe and the elephant were able to drink the water. The other animals agreed to fill the place with soil, the water came up and they drunk without paying anything.</p>
<p>The frogs were annoyed and they figured out other ways to prevent the animals from drinking the water or else they pay twice the price. They took grass and covered over the water, they planted grass around the water. Other animals like the cows and the elephant were very happy they went and grazed the whole grass and when they had finished grazing they drunk the water, but they didn't pay anything. When the frogs saw that they were annoyed. They held a meeting again and they agreed that all the female frogs should lay eggs on top of the water so that the eggs cover the water to prevent the animals from drinking the water. The female frogs spent night and day for two months laying eggs as they arranged them on top of the whole water.</p>
<p>The water was covered with eggs on top, when the wild animals came and found that the water had been covered by the egss they became very angry. But the frogs felt that was the best way for them to prevent them from drinking their water or if they needed they had to pay first. The snake and the fish went and ate all of those eggs, water remained open and the wild animals drunk the water without paying any money to the frogs. All the frogs were annoyed because their water was being used and yet they were the head of the water but they were not being paid.</p>
<p>The frogs organized for a meeting and they discussed on how they can do to avoid the animals' driking their water, without paying money or if they want to drink they pay twice the way it is supposed. For two weeks both day and night they stayed without sleeping. They thought of what they could do. They agreed that they go and hide themselves on the shores of the water, after doing that each frog was to start making noise:</p>
<p>Kwoooo, kwooooo, kwooooo</p>
<p>Each frog was to make loud noise, so that wherever the animals are they should be able to hear the noise. They made the noise like that each frog was making the noise. They were doing that all the time, both day and night, at loud voice so that the animals can be scared from drinking the water or they pay for it if they want. They also agreed that whenever a frog wanted to rest, they were bask themselves on top of the water with the eyes wide open. So that the animals can fear to drink the water or they pay twice inorder to drink the water.</p>
<p>The frogs continued to make the noise for many days. They made a lot of noise, each frog struggled for its voice to be heard to prevent the animals from drinking the water, or they pay. They made noise like this Kwoooo   kwooooo kwoooooo. They continued like that for many years, even today when the frogs hide themselves you hear them making this noise Kwoooo   kwooooo kwoooooo. That is the reason to why when you pass near water body you hear the frogs making noise. They scare the other animals or cow because they still claim the water rule cow from drinking water. All water belongs to the frogs. If the other animals want to use it they should pay or when they hear the sound they get scared and leave the water to the frogs.</p>
