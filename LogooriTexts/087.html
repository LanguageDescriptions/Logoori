Kwa kaduka ku musala kumanya kumwalitse ma kutange kwagula tsinzagayaga ni kumwalitsi." Na mulala ku vana vene yavo galoleka yali m,usiro nalonda ga vandi yava vavola. Ma oyo nakunika tsimoni niyagulanga tsinzagayaga na amwalitsi; na vandi yava vahenzi, vagula valola iyi inyengu, iyi ingomelu, iyi endoto. Lwa vavolana "basi, kwa kagula tsiduchi kutsie." ma nivika ku musala yikwo ndio vatsie yengo. lwa vaduka hasi vahenza ku, uyu nahenza ku tsietsie anyola ni tsimbisi, tsinde tsindoto na vache yava ndi vaveye natsio tsindahi tsiene tsimugi papa, tsinyengu tsingomelu tsindahi. navateva "munyi mwagulanji ndi na yinze ndi?" Vamuvolela gene yago na gogo, yive kuli kwagulanji kunyi kumanyi da. Kunyi lwa kovoye kumwalitse tsimoni waguli, kokoli kuli kovolani kokole." Navavola nindi nzie kwagula ku musala gundi kuli tsinyu yitsi. Vamuvolela "aye, kunyi sasa kukulinda da. Yivi chokola utigale ku musala utsie kunina ku musala. Na nivamuvolela kumanya kutsie na inzila ya kolondela mu kulavika mu lisambu; kuduka hala kulakula lisambu; na kumbe linani lihula. Lwa yatula ku musala ni yakika yaguye sasa tsinyengu yenya atsie natsio. Ma asimuka atsitsanga yengo. Anyola lisambu lila ha vavoye valakuli, linde liveye ho. Ku badala yo kolonda ku lia vakana vala valakulanga, kumbe alondanga ku lia linani lialakula. Nalonda ilanini yi linani natsia naduka ha yaduka nigaloleka hano ni yengo da; nzitsa hayi. Na kumbe uduchi ha inyumba ya manani. Lwa manani gamulola ni gamukaribisha; mugeni karibu, ma nakaribia. Lwa yingila mmba mula ndi, manani gavola si kwa kanyola. Ni gabanga sasa kuli genya gamukole. Lwa gavolananga mukana mwene ula yahula kuli gavola, genya gamwite gamunyanye. Cha yamanya nakola navola weiya, sasa ndakaduka mu hatari. Na mukana ula navola manani gala "na inze manya ngunzila ku hasi ndi da, ma ngunzila igulu yila ndi." Gavola basi kali niva ni igulu ulagunzila wene yila na kunyi hasi yaha; mbo ku kuveye muno.

<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Girls in the forest</p>
<p>We had some girls who went to the forest to look for fruits. When they arrived there they told one another that when they get there they would climb on the tree and look. When we get on the tree we shall close our eyes then we start to pluck the fruits with our eyes closed. One of the girls was a fool and she followed what the other said. She closed her eyes and plucked the fruits with the eyes closed, and the other plucked the ripe and big fruits. After that they said that it was enough and they decided to go back home. They climbed down from the tree and wen home. When they reached down they started comparing their fruits. Her fruits were not ripe, and others had ones that were ripe. She asked them how they plucked theirs. They told them that it was her problem and they do not know about that. </p>
<p>When we had closed our eyes we did just as we had agreed, she told them that they wait for her to go and pluck fruits that were ripen like theirs from the other tree. They told her that they wont wait for her. What she was to do was to remain and go and climb on the tree. They told her that they put leaves on the route that they will take, and the ogre was listening to it. When she had finished plucking the ripe fruits, she went and found the first leaf and there is also another leaf. Now instead of following the leaf that the girls had dropped she followed the one that the ogre had dropped.  </p>
<p>She followed the ogre and reached at a point and realized that she was not heading home. She wondered where she was going. And she was near the ogre's house. When the ogres saw her they welcomed her. "Welcome visitor" the ogres said. Then she entered the house. The ogre said that they had found her. They planed how they were going to work on her. While they were taking the girl heard what they were saying they want to kill and eat her. She sensed that she was in danger. She told those ogres that she wont stay down like that she wants to stay up. The ogres said "even if it is up and we down it is okay since we are in the same house." The girl climbed on top of the house and the ogres remained down and talked about their own stories. The way they are going to handle the girl and she was up there listening to it. </p>
<p>The ogres were huge and appeared to have big nose. They wanted to kill and eat her. She knew that she was in trouble. She took the fruits that she had and she threw them inside the fire. They removed sparks that got into the eyes of the ogres. They felt the pain and she added more. The ogres wondered what was happening inside that house. They looked around but they didn't see anything. Now when they were about to look where she was, she took all that she had and threw them on the fire and they sparkled tula! tula! tula! And entered into the ogres eyes. </p>
<p>The ogres could not manage that and they ran away from the house and went outside. They went outside to look for help. They went where the water was to clean their eyes. When the girl saw that they had gone she climbed down slowly and went home. It has ended there. It teaches us that we should be clever, do not just do what someone asks you to do.</p>
