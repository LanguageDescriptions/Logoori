<p><b>Mutevi:</b> Mukere ngoteva kijira ki vakali vatsitsa lukali na vasatsa valeta vakali?</p>
<p><b>Mutevwa:</b> Chajira vasatsa valeta vakali na vakali vatsia lukali ni kijira valombanga lwuvulu. Mundu musatsa nukamenye vutsa na nuveye nu mukali mu ulangwe mundu? Vavugulanaga kijira valomba mukali nu musatsa ma nivavola mukali alatsia ku musatsa atsie kolomba lushai watsiyi na mukana naye atsie ku musatsa atsie kolomba ulushai wanga musatsa; nivahambanyia vandu vene yavo. Kijira vujira mukali ngani vandu yava vaveye kunu dave; vujira livula ngani vandu yava vaveye kunu? Yicho chajira vavola mukali ulatula yengo winyu utsie ku musatsa nu mukana na yive ulatula winyu utsie ku musatsa ma mulombe ulushia. Ku ilwo lwa mulolanga lushia lwa Abraham nu lulanda kijira nyasaye yavolela Abraham ndakwamila avana ku magina. Lushai lwene yilu lulandanga kijira gene yago. Yive nuva weng'ine ma wivuli?

Navutswa vumwavo, vuvotso; si mwenga. Ni mwalagilanga vuchima halala mwenganga. Si mwalombanga lushia lwinyu dave; lushia lwinyu lwalange vutsa.

<p>QUESTIONS PREPARED BY KELVIN ALULU</p>
<p>Henry Nyareso: Woman I am asking you why were women getting married and why were men marrying?</p>
<p>Jedda Mmbone: What made men to marry and women to get married is because they were making a lineage. A man you can't just stay without a woman and you be recognized as a person. They were getting married to form a companion of a wife and a husband. A woman will go to the husband to make a family that is what brought those people together. Without a woman these people could not be there, without giving birth these people could not be there. That is why they said that a woman will leave her home and get united to a husband to form a family. That is why you see the lineage of Abraham spreading because god told Abraham that he will gie him many descendants. These lineage is spreading because of that. if you are alone can you give birth? You have to be two inorder to form a lineage like the one that we are in.</p>
<p>Henry Nyareso: Marriage at first was based on love or wealth; the way we see if someone has money they follow him here by here?</p>
<p>Jedda Mmbone: No, long time ago if a husband asked you, even if he has nothing you will go to make your wealth, they were not marrying because of wealth. Virginity was considered as wealth. There was no money so they used to see if a man has land, they could ask the girl to get married to that man and they go to make there wealth. They didn't have wealth; you were coming together then you go and make your wealth, we buy a sheep, a hen. When the hen hatch chicks that is when you look like people in a family. There was no money and they were not looking for one to marry a rich person. Long time ago they used to say "no you grew up from a humble family, get married to a rich person and you will see" people used to ask the poor to get married to the poor so that they can make their wealth. Women were not considering wealth. These days is when someone there is nothing that I can get from this person. Even the parents find themselves supporting the children in such matter "why get married to this person where there is poverty" they used to say you go and make your wealth together and yo love one another.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Henry Nyareso: Why are maragooli or african people not considering a woman as somebody if she gives birth to girls alone at the home where she is married?</p>
<p>Jedda Mmbone: They used to view girls from a different perspective, a girl didn't receive anything where she was raised from. They used to say a girl should get married to another home and the boy should marry a wife and bring her home so that the father can be praised that he is a man who has sons that have married women and brought them home. Boys have powers than girls. </p>
<p>Henry Nyareso: Even for you, you agreed that if someone has given birth to girls alone, they should say that she has given birth to frogs?</p>
<p>Jedda Mmbone: You were worried and you say "I could have given birth to one that would have taken care of me, when these girls will get married I will remain with what?" so if you remain with a boy he will marry a woman, they will make the home.</p>
<p>Henry Nyareso: Why are people not allowed to marry from the same clan, or marry a relative?</p>
<p>Jedda Mmbone: It was difficult for you, you are at your home, your girl has been married. The girl that is there has given birth then your brother marries a girl and gives birth to a child. These children cannot marry each other. A brother and a sister cannot marry. If you had sex together you were heading towards death. You were not making your lineage; your lineage was nothing. These days they say; if you have married from the same clan you look for herbalists. If the girl has refused to leave the boy and the boy has refused to leave the girl, that relationship is not normal. It is not from the ancestor. They used to keep a sign on the top of their house, because they have refused then they wonder what to do and they decide to put a sign on the roof of their house.</p>
<p>Henry Nyareso: They used to keep the sign (it was a bucket that was cut then put on the roof) on the grass thatched house, these days relatives marry but the sign is not kept on top if the house.</p>
<p>Jedda Mmbone: That is the reason to why you see there is a lot of death. If you just look at the relative who married a sister, the home is not good, there are lame people, there are blind. They didn't give birth to a normal child. </p>
<p>Henry Nyareso: It is a dangerous thing, men of these days are in that condition we see children walking with their sisters and mistakes happen. Do you see these things continuing like that or how?</p>
<p>Jedda Mmbone: How can they teach and the grandfathers are getting attracted to their granddaughters? If we return to that way we will perish very fast. You wont finish the years that you were given. Your sister in law should never cheat you to sleep together; you will have brought death in that village.</p>
<p>Henry Nyareso: If we are talking about getting in good terms between a boy and a girl; is it a girl who is soothing the boy? </p>
<p>Jedda Mmbone: It was a boy who was soothing the girl. These days children are spoiled when a boy says that he wants the girl; the girl starts to follow him immediately. Long ago you used to run away and a boy can chase you for even six months inorder to reach you.</p>
<p>Henry Nyareso: These days weddings are lightly and some laws are feared by people.</p>
<p>Jedda Mmbone: Long time there was a wedding for singing and the other one was for matching. Like the one that you see people coming in vehicles. If I saw that I have nothing, I used to go for that of matching.</p>
<p>Henry Nyareso: The laws of life, you have said that there were women who are teaching them. Who can teach them today?</p>
<p>Jedda Mmbone: These days we do not have, you are seeing us encouraging the yourth to take heed of our instructions. You should look at my ways, you should see when I came from Maragooli to this place what am I doing; have I done any wrong thing. If you see I am okey, you should follow my instructions. They will make you live long without moving up and down. That is the reason to why we are encouraging you that if you have a husband trust him, if you have the desire for sex, take a vehicle and visit your husband. If he asks you why you have come, tell him that you hae come to visit him as your husband. He will treat you and you will finish that desire and then you return and relax.</p>
<p>Henry Nyareso: I believe there are people inside here who are listening, the laws of life are there but they are not considered these days. Those that do not have the laws of life, they bring shame on women who are not in the same condition or age as you, you are like a teacher. You see this one has cut the rope; if you have not heard. You have made us happy when you told us the ways in which people conduct themselves. These days you see one with the stomach outside, it is open. It's like being naked or how do you see?</p>
<p>Jedda Mmbone: It is very bad you even become ashame.</p>
<p>Henry Nyareso: You used to hide your naked bodies, how do you see it these days?</p>
<p>Jedda Mmbone: We used to cover ours, these days you see they are naked they show people their bodies. You get worried and you wonder what is this child doing. Some put on clothes that one is not supposed to enter with in the house of God and you find her inside there. You just keep quiet because you know if you speak something it will be a different issue. Even the mother when she hears you speaking about that she says that they are things that came to this world, since they are young they do not know it. They can tell their children to walk accordingly, and dance well like a christian. Do not shake your body where people are; you may be looking for other things. And men are not looking with the eye; the way we look by side.</p>
<p>Henry Nyareso: Now we see you worried with the ways of children and their dressing mode. But those things are there. You were seeing the right ways or the ways of life in the past and the new that are penetrating through these days. Where are you? Do you preffer putting up with the current or forcing the teaching of the past?</p>
<p>Jedda Mmbone: Even if it is teaching they are not coming to church; where will you teach them from. Now the way we are in here there are some who are hearing, and if you ask them to come to church and hear, they try and other hear. Your mother used to tell you that if you go to ahome where there are five boys; you should not commit adultery with another boy. Even if you feel like, you do it with a neighbor because adultery does not lack. I will tell you that adultery has been on people and the person who was doing adultery is the one who didn't follow the laws, she left the laws. If you get hold of the laws you do not even want another husband, you just see your husband even when you are asleep. These days people don't know that, she feels doing her own things because the husband is not near. Again commit adultery in your husband's house is not good. They sleep on another husbands bed and when you come and sleep on it, you have been blinded.</p>
<p>Henry Nyareso: The ego of a man, there were some who had several wives like chief, like the house that Trufena is in, Arusa had several wives. A son is born and he says that father had wives, and he remains in that misbehaviour. In church you normaly say that one should pray and repent for this behaviour to go away. Can these behaviour get finished?</p>
<p>Jedda Mmbone: Yes, to some people, if you believe it can get finished. I have told you before that for a man that thing remains in the blood until a child will be born who will inherit it too. Long time ago a man used to pick on women and have them. One of the women was good and she used to give him food, and the others were bad. They could cook very fast, or if he tasted their meals they were not good. And when he returns to the first wife she gives him baked maize flour, tea and she has boiled the water. He used to give that wife something good, and he tells her that she has been good to him and she treats him well and the others were just there. Whatever he got he didn't deny but he shared with them. These days when a husband gets something he forgets the other women. These women begin to have grudges, they start to fight. But if you take good care of them and you tell them the way they should stay and you explain to them that you are the provider but you do not have something, whatever I have if I share with you, I build you a house, I have given you land. If you marry women then you do not build a house for them, you do not do that for them, do you think the wife will stay with you? And among the three or four women one comes out who loves the husband, but he will not stop sleeping with other women, he will assign days; he say two days for one same to the other women and he can stay there for three days or one week, because he is treated well by that woman.</p>
<p>Henry Nyareso: Now according to your thoughts, I did a wedding with my one wife and I have trusted her, but she has some weakness. She does not bring food on the table very fast, she does not respond quickly. But when you walk, you find one with love that brings you close that is the reason to why some are doing polygamy but you have done a wedding and you have trusted your own. Now when you find the one with love that is attractive, I like a man what should I do? Can I jump there or what?</p>
<p>Jedda Mmbone: Once she has cooked for you, you have liked it and you have sat and eaten it well. The ones who have wedded you've seen them they are spoiled. They spoil not because of their wish, he get's spoiled because of some women who are fools. There are some women who are fools, they do not cook, some do not bath.</p>
<p>Henry Nyareso: So instead of ashaming her, you just leave her slowly?</p>
<p>Jedda Mmbone: You will just give her because she is yours, you won't deny her. You give her and you know that she is like that. Even a famous leader in Maragoli by the name Odanga, had 21 women but one wife defeated all; but he did not despise them, he was still visiting them. He brought some land. Some gave birth with other people, he could not manage 21 women.</p>
<p>Henry Nyareso: Did you see Odanga with your eyes?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jedda Mmbone: Yes Odanga was staying in Sabatia and our home is Lososi(it the neighbouring village to sabatia)</p>
<p>Henry Nyareso: In that family children have several wives; as it was done by their grandfather.</p>
<p>Jedda Mmbone: Yes they have, they have not left it. The one that has been chosen by God he says that it is foolishness, he prefer having one wife who gives birth to children that they will take care of.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
