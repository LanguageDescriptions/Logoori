<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Getting a child before marriage</p>
<p>I am Carolyne Chesi and I am going to tell you story about a girl who gives birth to a child while at home before marriage.</p>
<p>When a girl had matured she began to walk with boys outside and if the mother knew she used to ask her. But raising a girl is very difficult. The type of the child is known from what she does. The way she can cheat her mother that the teacher gave them work and they were sharing a book and the child that I am studying with has gone with the book and I want to go and write the work that the teacher gave us from his home. The mother keeps quiet. The second time she can cheat her that they are going to games and it very far and she does not know the time when she will return home. The mother keeps quiet. The third time she normaly cheat the mother that the child whom she is studying with, was sick and she took his books and she want to take them back. The mother cuts a stick and then she keeps quiet. The child continues to cheat the mother, and she contnues to keep quiet. She normaly tells her that there is something that will reveal her. </p>
<p>When the mother has kept quiet there comes a time when the girl is pregnant. The mother observes the conditions at which the girl is in. some will have a clear face, another one can rest in the morning while the others will refuse milk tea. She does not take anything or something that she doesn't like in her life. She can like things like bananas or avocado. When the mothers see that she knows that the girl is pregnant. When the mother see that she normaly send a woman to check for her if the daughter is pregnant. The girl is shy. She is not active. The mother perservires for a while. She normaly sends one of her best friend to the child but the child does not accept easily. She denies the truth from the friend. The mother sends women or one woman. She looks for a woman that communicates with the girl well but she does not accept.</p>
<p>The mother leaves her alone but she normaly gets worried. She is always worried and wonders whether the girl got pregnant from a relative. She normaly tells her that there will come a day when she will accept. She leaves her alone. The girl continues being pregnant until the days when she will be near to give birth to her child. This girl does not finish nine months, she may finish eight or eight and a half month. When the day comes when she is in pain, they ask her where she got pregnant. She keeps quiet. The woman tell her that there will come a time when she will speak it without even knowing that she is revealing the truth. They keep quiet. </p>
<p>The girl starts to have pain when the child wants to come out, when she starts to scream or when she start to crawl, they ask her where she got pregnant. She normaly says the truth and the women tell her you were making yourself clever and now you have told us the truth without hiding it. They assist her when the child comes out then they clap their hands and the girl is put somewhere to rest. The mother sends two women to the home where the girl got pregnant. They go there and they give the information. The women go there and they tell the mother to the son who impregnanted the girl and the mother calls her son "come and hear what these women are saying" this boy comes and the women explain the information to the boy. If the boy is good, he will accept, but some may be ashamed and afraid because others will laugh at him because he has given birth to a child hence he doesn't accept it easily. If the mother is good she may visit the home where the boy impregnated the girl and she may carry a shirt that belongs to her son together with soap, towel and she carries some clothes together with sugar and some of them carry flour and they go. </p>
<p>When she arrives there, they bring the child and she keeps the baby inside the shirt once she has bathed the child. She takes little sugar and puts it inside the mouth of the child then they cook porridge. After cooking the porridge she takes it and gives it to the baby. If the baby does not belong to her family, the baby does not sleep. The mother leaves the place and returns home. And if the boy has accepted it becomes easy. When they bring the report that the girl has given birth to a baby, the mother in law normaly asks them to carry the baby to her home. The mother to the girl who has given birth, looks for some women then they carry the baby to the boy's home. The girl stays at the home of the boy until the day of shaving the baby. When they are shaving the baby the mother calls his son and asks him, "while we are shaving this baby, is the mother returning home or she will remain here?" if the boy accepts, they also ask the girl if she will stay in her marriage or she will return home.If they have both accepted, they now shave the baby and the girl stays in her marriage. When the girl stays in her marriage, they send women back to give information that the boy has refused to leave the girl, and the women that are sent there are given sugar. And it happens that the girl has to return back with the child because the boy is not mature enough to marry. They will call him when they will be baptising the baby. That is all that I wanted to tell you concerning the child who has given birth to a child before marriage. </p>
<p>THINGS THAT HAPPEN DURING THE YEAR</p>
<p>On 1st of January we go to church to thank God for what he has done for us throughout the whole of the previous year until the day of 1st of January. This month has a lot of things, people are starting the year. Others go to church to thank God, while others do not go to church these are some of the people who drink beer. When you meet them they tell you "Happy as you eat" and they are drank, they are not from the church. But if God has taken care of you throughout the year, you should go to church to start a new year by appreciating him because you do not know what will happen during that year. When the year begins we rest for a week as we figure out how children will go to school. The way we can plough and get maize and the fertilizer for planting maize. The children who have sat for their final exam in class eight are the ones that we worry about. The new year has a lot of things to be done. The previous year, we spend on clothes and celebrations. And also visiting our children in our houses. We forget when we get to january that our children are supposed to go to school and because a woman is the one who speaks in the house, if she see that there is a cow she normaly ask her husband to sell it so that they can take the child to school. Or they sell part of their land and take the child to school when the child finish school she will buy for the another land or cow.  </p>
<p>And after selling these items the money will be used in buying maize and fertilizer for planting. If they agree they normaly do that and others and spent their money on celebrations and forgot that the children are supposed to go to school, people are supposed to dig the farm, buy fertilizer and the maize to plant. When he forget that he says that the government is there and it will educate our children forgeting that the child has to pass the exams well. When we get to the second month it is the month for planting maize. Some are not prepared and they do not have maize and the fertilizer for planting.  Those are the ones who disturb their neighbors and relatives by borrowing maize together with fertilizer for planting. Such type of a person is one who had not prepared his plans. A person who is prepared with his plans when it rains he goes out with his maize and fertilizer for planting his maize. He has put his things in order. And if it rain well, when the crops have germinated we normaly weed them towards the end of march or april. The days of april towards may are days of hunger and sickness. When the hunger is on the money is not available. You can ask someone to work for you but you won't pay that person because you do not have money. There is a lot of sickness because of the rain. Pneumonia and malaria normaly kill may people during these days. Because this person does not have enough money to go to the hospital. People begin to harvest beans on may or maybe towards the end of june. During these days you can call someone to work for you then you ask that person to take some of the pre-harvested beans and cook it because you do not have enough money to pay that person at that time. </p>
<p>And ask the person to wait when you will harvest the beans you will pay him/her. When we get to the seventh month people start eating pre-harvested maize. They eat the local maragoli maize (maduma ge kelogoli) and if you planted hybrid you will have to wait until the nineth month. Some plant maize while others harvest their maize. If you planted hybrid maize you cut and put the remainings together then you plough the farm. You dig as you plant until the month of october that is when people begin to weed their maize. They weed the maize upto the month of november. The month of november has a lot of things; there is decoration of the houses. Others repair their walls. After that they go to bring soil and some use black soil to decorate their houses while others uses white soil. This work is done by young children because they know that if they do not do the work you won't take them to the church to sing christmas bells. </p>
<p>When you ask them to go and bring the soil for decorating the house they run very fast. If you ask them to go and look for firewood from the forest before going to sing they run very fast. They do that work very fast because they know that if they do it they will get clothes and shoes for christmass. And because wmen are clever they save money from the month of january so that if one has a problem she can borrow and bring back with some interest. They share the money on December. When the month of december comes the women call each other then they share the money, they use the money to buy for their children what they need; clothes, shoes and food for eating during the celebration. During this month children sing the christmass bells and women do it also. But women do not start their practices early. They start practicing between 20th of December and 23rd of December. Because they began singing long time ago and they have memorized the songs. They do not have much problem. The date of December 25th is a happy day, it is a day when the child was born. It is also a day that has a lot of activities. During this day we have a lot of drank people whle others go to visit their people. Some call their relatives and they celebrate together. Some go to sing or watch people performing christmass bells, while others stay at home. And those who drink they drink and say that they are celebrating. The following morning on 26th it is boxing day. One may tell you that it is a day for opening boxes. Others go to cultural celebrations at Mbale. That is how we begin the year and finish it.</p>
<p>I have a story about an ogre and beans.</p>
<p>Long time ago one woman by the name Kayesa. She had three children who were girls. She knew how to cook beans very well. She asked her children to go with her to the farm, and one of them to cook beans. They weeded until in the evening when she saw the sunset she asked her children to stop and they return home. They went home and found Liani sleeping. Kayesa looked inside the pot but she didn't see the beans, but she saw stones. She asked Liani to explain who ate the beans. Liani said that she doesn't know. She asked her children to go and cross the river and one of them to sing this song as she cross:</p>
<p>I was not the one*2</p>
<p>Who stole the beans*2</p>
<p>I jump once and fall in water eeeeh water</p>
<p>As I fall in the water</p>
<p></p>
<p>The woman sang this song as she crossed the bridge. Other children sang as they crossed and Liani jumped and fell into the water.</p>
<p>NDIEGU WITH THE CHILD</p>
<p>Long time ago there was a woman by the name Ndiegu. There came hunger in the world. She went to look for food and found it. She came and cooked it then she ate and denied her child. The following morning the child woke up hungry and he went to look for food in the forest. he found the food and cooked it then he denied his mother. Ndiegu waited for her child to share a little meal but the child refused. When the neighbors heard that she cooked and denied her child, they asked her why she wanted the child to give her yet she denied him her meals. The neighbors began laughing at her as they sang this song:</p>
<p>Ndiegu went to look for food</p>
<p>She denied the child</p>
<p>And the child went to look for food</p>
<p>He denied the mother</p>
<p>Ndiegu you are crying</p>
<p>Tsunu tsunu tsunu tsunu.</p>
<p>From that time Ndiegu did not deny her child food again and the child has not denied the mother food. They stayed in peace and joy.</p>
<p>Thankyou.</p>
