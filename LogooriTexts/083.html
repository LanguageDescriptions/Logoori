<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">A man and a girl</p>
<p>Long time ago we had a man who had his wife and they stayed together. They were lucky to get a girl. They educated their child and she finished school and got married to a man. When she stayed at her husband's place for a while, there came a time and she said that she wanted to go and visit her parents back home. The husband told her "do not go, I have heard that your father and mother are ogres" the girl refused and said that she has to go and visit her parents. She took children and ran away with them to her parent's home. She had two children one was still very young. When she arrived there she spent one night and the following day in the morning she took a bucket and went to the river to fetch water. When she came back from the river she found her child screaming. She asked her mother why her child was crying like that. The mother said that the child was just crying.</p>
<p>The girl kept quiet then she went to the river and when she returned home she found the child still crying. She asked her mother "what is happening to my child?" the girl kept the bucket of water down and she went and took her child. When she looked keenly on her child she realized that the mother had bitten the fingers of her child. The girl thought for a while and she said to her self "it true my husband was telling me the truth" she started getting worried. She took her children and carried one on her back and the other one she carried her in her arms then she climbed on a tree. People didn't know where she was, and they wondered where she had gone and she started singing:</p>
<p>Olomi warned me*2</p>
<p>Your mother has turned into an ogre</p>
<p>Your father has turned into an ogre</p>
<p>The dogs have bitten harshly</p>
<p>Olomi weeeee bell</p>
<p>She listened keenly, then her parents looked for her. When the looked they saw her on a tree, the mother took an axe and she started to cut the tree. She continued to cut as the girl sang: </p>
<p>Olomi warned me*2</p>
<p>Your mother has turned into an ogre</p>
<p>Your father has turned into an ogre</p>
<p>The dogs have bitten harshly</p>
<p>Olomi weeeee bell</p>
<p>Olomi heard from far and said "ah! She is my wife, I warned her" he listened keenly where she was singing from and the mother continued to cut the tree, and she sang:</p>
<p>Olomi warned me*2</p>
<p>Your mother has turned into an ogre</p>
<p>Your father has turned into an ogre</p>
<p>The dogs have bitten harshly</p>
<p>Olomi weeeee bell</p>
<p>Olomi gathered his dogs, and came with them; he found that the tree was near to fall. When the dog saw the old man and the woman, they started chasing them. And the girl came down very fast and the husband accepted her and they went home. Then it ends there.</p>
