<p style = "font-style: normal;font-weight: bold;">Life in the past</p>
<p>I will start by talking about the things in the past, and how people were living in the past. I will start by recognizing, the way we began in life and strengthening the house of God in the year 1948. They took great faith in the house of God. It was started by white men, they went to a woman's house and they owner knew that they had come to pray. They used to go and pray as they cleansed themselves. And they had an aim of keeping the Pentecostal things. While they were staying in the house they spent in there from Monday to Sunday and they had led in their leadership. They wanted to pray and see the Holy Spirit. Some people had not known the Holy Spirit and some had received the Holy Spirit. And they taught others how they could receive Holy Spirit. They asked them to repent their sins from their childhood. You used to do childish things and since you are grown now, you have done some things that are good while the others are not good. You repent sins that you did since your childhood. You repent as you cry and you refuse, you also kneel down. You knelt down as you cry and ask how you will receive Holy Spirit. And you were praying as you cry in need of Holy Spirit, you shed tears. If you wanted to know that you've received the Holy Spirit, you used to see the lightning shining where you were. You used to see the lightning, and your heart goes deep, then you get Holy Spirit. When you receive the Holy Spirit, you were to take care of yourself; you should not speak bad about the others. When you find someone has left his/her property do not steal it. They used to give us those instructions and you walk as you keep them. You pray as you walk, even if someone speaks against you, you just take is as a joke. You do not want to follow him. People from the year 1948-1950 had great faith in God. They felt that they were living with joy, one could not deny the other one something. It was joy, they organized for their church then they sing their songs as they pray, this was one of the songs:</p>
<p>Today I am standing with the angels</p>
<p>I am standing in front and I have accepted</p>
<p>I have been seen in the things of the earth</p>
<p>Rubai have accepted to do his will</p>
<p></p>
<p>Today I am standing with the angels</p>
<p>I am standing in front and I have accepted</p>
<p>I have been seen in the things of the earth</p>
<p>Rubai have accepted to do his will</p>
<p>They used to sing like that and they knew. When they got to the year 1952 a white man came from abroad and stayed in this land. His name was Clark and he came and found that people didn't have something to eat. When he came to the church, he used to preach that we Christians should wash our cloths and look as the people of God. When you appear as the people of God, the word of God will stay in you, and you wont be cheated or criticized. He used to teach as everyone sees. After teaching then he says to his servants "go and look for a place where you can cook tea" then they start to prepare tea. Then he asks all the people to sit down and take tea. Some people didn't know how to drink tea. Long time when the sugar was there they were using lemon leaves. After putting the leaves on the cooking pan, he then adds in water, they were not adding in milk.</p>
<p>But when the white men came, they asked them to be taking tea that has tealeaves. That is when people knew about adding milk to the tea. And we started knowing if the sugar was enough or not. They used to ensure that people have taken tea well. People now knew tea, until they discovered that Christianity is good. People used to try their level best, saying that they want to go to the church and find the white man with the tea prepared and they will take it. People used to rush and they fill the church, they were prayed for and the people received the Holy Spirit. And you find people singing gospel songs. They were singing as they praised God. They began singing this song:</p>
<p>I will praise him very much</p>
<p>My savior</p>
<p>And I love the name of the savior</p>
<p>We praise Jesus</p>
<p>His name should be praised</p>
<p>All of us will be happy</p>
<p>Jesus the lord is near</p>
<p>Jesus *3</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is his name that we love</p>
<p>His name alone</p>
<p>It chase away our fears</p>
<p>Today we praise Jesus</p>
<p>His name should be praised</p>
<p>All of us will be happy</p>
<p>Jesus the lord is near </p>
<p>Jesus *3</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your sins are huge</p>
<p>Jesus has forgiven</p>
<p>You go in peace</p>
<p>Today we praise Jesus</p>
<p>His name should be praised</p>
<p>All of us will be happy</p>
<p>Jesus the lord is near </p>
<p>Jesus *3</p>
<p>I will praise him very much</p>
<p>My savior</p>
<p>And I love the name of the savior</p>
<p>We praise Jesus</p>
<p>His name should be praised</p>
<p>All of us will be happy</p>
<p>Jesus the lord is near</p>
<p>Jesus *3</p>
<p>After singing these songs they used to go and bring hymnbooks. Then they say that the people who are able to read they sing those songs from the books as they praise God and live in the things of the lord. That is when people learned the word of God and they went to preach in Nyang'ori they were staying there than they take the bible then they go and call people and they preach. That is how the preachers became many and they asked people to see the word of God. The time when you will see people have taken the things of the world and making their own religions. That is when you will know the destruction is near. Then they said that someone who took the word of god and builds it in a rock is like the Christian that God has called and he will never do anything bad. He is walking as he is read from the front to the back. They encouraged everyone to be reading the bible. Everyone took the bible and began reading his verse that assisted him in his life. And they taught us that psalm 1 says: he has blessings, he who does not walk in the counsel of wickedness. He does not seat of mockers, but loves the ways of the lord and meditates upon them day and night, he is like a tree planted by the stream of water that never lacks water nor withers, everything that he does he prospers. They encourage us with the verse. We again read from the book of John 14 that says: you should not be afraid in your hearts, you believe in God, believe in me, in my father's house there are many mansion rooms. If it were not for that I am telling you that I am going to make a place for you. I will go and return back to take you. Whenever someone read that verse he felt that he had a lot of joy. He also felt that he was praising God. He also took heed of the laws. They used to say that you keep the 10 commandments. You should not commit adultery, you should not steal, you should not covet your neighbor's property, and you should not covet a girl. Those are the things that filled our lives. We lived in the salvation of Christ. People in the past had enough activities. Whenever they hold the law, they never left it. They were telling us that if you loose the law then you are not a good Christian. A Christians builds his house on a rock, he does not listen to what the people say, he does not listen to bad things that people speak against the others. He does not walk with bad people. He does not sit in bad companies. He stays at home thinking about his tasks, if his cow has been fed, if his children have eaten, will he be able to do farming, will he plant vegetables? We used to live like that, we are believers of Christ and that is the reason to why we are walking in the ways of Christ. I believe my words have ended there in emphasizing the salvation of Christ. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Story </p>
<p>There was a woman who had seeds for planting, when people went there to ask for the seeds, they used to sing:</p>
<p>Mother give me the seeds I go to sow*2</p>
<p>When you see meat, you grind the maize as you dance</p>
<p>I go I go I go to sow</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mother give me the seeds I go to sow*2</p>
<p>When you see meat, you grind the maize as you dance</p>
<p>I go I go I go to sow</p>
<p></p>
<p>If it were not for it, hunger could have killed us</p>
<p>When you see meat, you grind the maize as you dance</p>
<p>I go I go I go to sow</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
